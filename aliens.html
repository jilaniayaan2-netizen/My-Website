                    <h1>👾 ALIENS 👾</h1>
                    <p>I love aliens and 100% I believe they exist, though they likely haven't been to our planet just yet. My love for aliens comes from the various speculative biology videos projects I've seen, if you don't know what speculative biology, its the concept of theorizing how something could possibly evolve. I've been so inspired by this that the story I'm writing started out as an excuse to make an alien ecosystem.</p>
                </div>
            </header>
            <article>
                <div class="broider">
                    <h1>The Speculative World of C-100</h1>
                    <p>C-100 is the planet that my story, Expedition to C-100, takes place on. Before I show off all the amazing drawings my brother has made of the aliens along with their biology, I want to write about how details of the planet.</p>
                    <h2>Planet attributes</h2>
                    <p>Firstly, C-100 is a planet that's slighty smaller than earth meaning its gravity is significantly weaker than earth's. THe atmosphere is slighty denser and there is a higher oxygen level, not a deadly amount but it is comparable to the oxygen level during the Carbiniforous period. The planet is split into two mega continents, one in the east and one in the west. The western continent is mostly dense rainforest, except for the south, where it is mostly grasslands, and the north, where its mostly mountains. A large interconnected cave system lies underneath the western continent which holds its own ecosystem. The western continent is split into two by the western interior seaway and there are various islands in this seaway and around the continent. Around the seaway there is a swamp biome, to the north you enter a rocky and volcanic area, the middle of the continent is mostly dry grassland and small forests. The western continent lacks rainforests due to the fact its lower down south, which makes it too cold for most of the large tree-like organisms.</p>
                    <h2>The Limb Debacle</h2>
                    <p>The limb debacle is about the number of limbs for my aliens, which was one of the hardest things to figure out because I obviously did not want to have 4 limbs(that'd be boring and basic) but how would something that has 6 limbs or 2 limbs evolve? Because here on earth almost all vertabrates have 4 limbs because the first fish to crawl onto land also happened to have 4 limbs. So, by that logic, I made it that on C-100, 3 different species came onto land around the same time and evolved into various different land vertabrates. Each of the aliens had a different number of limbs, those being: 6, 4, and 2. So all vertabrates on C-100 will have 6, 4, or 2 limbs. This also means that if two aliens have the same amount of limbs that they are distantly related. Anyways, I can let you through now that I've cleared up the whole limb thing.</p>
                    <h2>The Fauna</h2>
                    <p>Now that I've told you about the planet, it's time to introduce you to it's inhabitants. Now note one thing, a lot of creatures have similar last names(I highkey kept forgetting that I used some of these words already). One example of this is "Interfectorem". This doesn't mean that those two aliens are related, I will mention in the details if it is realted to another creature or not.</p>
                    <h3>Volitare Silva</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="volitareSilva.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>Volitare Silva is one of the few creatures that lives in the sky that has 4 limbs, this is due to the strange story of it's evolution which is very similar to that of earth whales. It likely started as a small predator living in the mountains but began to slowly evolve to get food from the air over millions of years. Volitare Silva do not fly, instead they act more like a ballon, having a large organ on it's head that produces and stores helium, which is more than enough to keep it afloat. Volitare Silva are also incredibly dumb with tiny brains. They do stick together in groups but often end up floating away, carried by the wind currents. The most interesting thing about this alien is it's various symbiotic relationships that make it a keystone species. Firstly, many species of plants spread their seeds into the air, hoping to get on the backs of Volitare Silvas to avoid predation. This in turn camouflages it and also attracts Fluitanis Draconis hives to live on the Volitare Silva, which in turn helps protect the defensless creature from predation. </p>
                    <h3>Spinosa Lingua Venator</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="spinosoaLVenator.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>Spinosa L. Venator is a giant and specialized ariel predator. It has a beak that splits open in 3 different directions, which it uses to grip the slippery skin of Volitare Silva before it uses its harpoon-like tongue to pierce through it's hide and pop the organ that stores the helium. Spinosa L. Ventors are a completely air born species, they do not land for any reason and spend their whole lives in the sky. They give live birth and the second the baby is born, they are able to fly. Their wings act similarly to oars on a large ship, propelling through the air. They also happen to mate for life, forming deep social bonds with their partners. Males during mating season turn a deep purple and use the small spike at the end of their tail to dance for the females, the females will decide their mate based on their color, tail spike, and how well they can dance. The dance consists of doing loops and sharp turns in the air while also whipping around their tail.</p>
                    <h3>Cristatus Poncu Cursor</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="cristatusPCursor.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>Cristatus Poncu Cursor is a large herbivourous species that lives exclusively in the Poncu Savannah in the middle of the western continent. They live in large herds similar to water buffalo, similarly to water buffalo, they are incredibly short tempered and are quick to mob violence. There are multiple instances of an angry herd trampelling and killing lesser predators. They evolved to have multiple pairs of eyes to give themselves a near 360 degree field of vision, an adaptation to avoid the larger and more powerful predators. This species also shows great sexual dimorphism with the males being a iridescent dark green along with having a huge frill, while the females are a light reddish-brown which allows them to blend into the red plants of the savannah. Males use their frills to compete with one another for mates and for the right to lead the herd. These confrontations aren't physical, instead, the two males sing and flare open their frills while circling one another. During this, the male with the biggest and most colorful frill along with the best singing(which is similar to that of a song birds) wins.</p>
                    <h3>Armato Rege</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="armatoRege.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>Armato Rege is the apex predator of the western continent, with its range being the entire continent. Its front limbs are double jointed which allows it to use them for running or for slamming and grabbing lesser aliens. This on top of it being heavily armored makes it impossible for prey to fight back. So, how did it evolve armor considering that its a predator? This is because it shares a lot of its habitat with Terram Cete, a blue whale sized subterranean ambush predator, so to prevent being mauled by these giants, Armato Rege evolved armored spikes. If you go down to the north or forest, out of the range of Terram Cete, you'll notice the Armato Rege there are smaller and have weaker armor. Armato Rege are very intelligent, being curious about their surrondings and having a strong maternal instinct. Young Reges are raised up until the age of 10, which by then, they are capable of hunting on their own. These younglings then will join up into a group of 4-5 to hunt together called a "gang". These gangs will bully lesser creatures but occasionally will also try their hand at hunting Terram Cetes. They do this by using one individual to lure it out before the others grab it's limbs to pin it down while the last one goes for it's throat. Now, often they only do this when desperate and these hunts often end in 1 or more gang members being killed.</p>
                    <h3>Poncu Foidens</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="poncuFoidens.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>Poncu Foidens is acctually distnantly related to Cristatus Poncu Cursor but instead of going the route of giant social herds, they've instead opted for a more rodent like lifestyle, feeding mostly on grasses and roots. They burrow underground and live in small families of 5 individuals. These small creatures mate for life. Single males are known as den masters and will gaurd their burrow from other males, which often leads to fights. Once the male is able to attract a female, using a string of complex songs and dances which use their frills and antennae.</p>
                    <h3>Volantem Interfectorem</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="volantemInterfectorem.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>Volantem Interfectorem is a medium sized ariel predator that has a hunting strategy similar to a hawk, they dive up high before doing a low, high speed sweep through the tall grass to snap up any small creatures with their sideways jawz. They have eyes similar to that of a fly, which combined with their extra pair of wings makes them excellent at maneuvering through the air and avoiding larger predators in the air. Unlike other air predators, they are not permenetly airborn as their wings can fold, allowing them to walk similarly to large pterosaurs. They nest at the top of the large tree-like organisms, using the flat discs to build nests where they lay eggs and rear their young.</p>    
                    <h3>Terram Cete</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="terramCete.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>Terram Cete, as mentioned previously in the Armato Rege entry, is a massive super predator which gets up to 82 feet long. During their youth, they build up giant burrows which is where they live once they get larger. Once they get to their greatest size, they cannot move around the earth and tend to stay in their burrow. These super predators only need to rarely eat as their metabolism is so slow that it can go years without eating but when they do eat, they eat a massive amount of food. These creatures can reproduce asexually through parthenogenesis, this was evolved over hundreds of years as the Terram Cete got bigger and bigger which made it harder and harder to find mates. Terram Cete are completely blind and also have only two limbs, which is something rare for land animals on C-100.</p>    
                    <h3>Luminare Reptans</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="luminareReptans.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>Luminare Reptans are small, dog sized creatures that hunt in packs. Similarly to Terram Cete, they are blind and have two limbs. They are covered in head to toe with osteoderms and thick, leathery skin. These creatures are incredibly intelligent, having their own complex language that they use communicate with one another during hunts. Their tails are prehensile and they acctaully have opposible thumbs, some packs have been observed using tools such as primative spears. Other's were even observed carving wood into complex shapes like other aliens.</p>   
                    <h3>Invisibilia Interfectorem</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="invisibiliaInterfectorem.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>Invisibilia Interfectorem is a very specialized predator that lives in a small region where instead of forests made up of towering tree-like plants, they are made of purplish bamboo-like plants. These bamboo shoots aren't a type of grass but are more similar to the aqautic plants. This alien is mostly purple, which matches the plants around them, except the underbelly which is blue to match the sky. This isn't always the case as they do have the ability to change the shade of their skin, like less advanced chromatophores. It's eyes are on the underside of its head so that it can scan the forest floor for prey and its limbs are similar to skewers and are used to impale soft bodied prey. If this alien's legs are damaged, then it is most likely doomed to starve.</p>
                    <h3>Ferrum Maxilla</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="ferrumMaxilla.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>Ferrum Maxilla is a small herbivourous creature that lives in the bamboo forests that the Invisibilia Interfectorem lives in as well. Their scissor shaped head is specialized to cut down and then cut up the bamboo into managable pieces which it can then swallow. It's throat is lined with molars which are used to grind up the bamboo fully. They also use the scissor heads to defend themseleves against the Invisibilia Interfectorem by cutting off parts of their limbs, which often leads to the death of the predator. It's head is a bright red due to the high amounts of iron and its mouth parts are angled in a way where when its mouth opens and closes, its mouth parts sharpen themselves.</p>
                    <h3>Electrica Interfectorem</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="electricaInterfectorem.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>Electrica Interfectorem is a 4 limbed aqautic predator that lives in the rivers and lakes of the western continent. It's entire body is covered in holes, which produce fleshy orbs. These fleshy orbs will then scatter around the river, getting tangled in rocks, plants, etc, which creates a peremeter around it's ambush spot. This peremeter acts like a spiders web as whenever these orbs sense an electrical signal, they will produce an electrical signal which lets the alien know that something has entered it's territory. If its small, then its prey but if its large, its likely a rival wanting the territory for itself. It's three pairs of eyes are a residual trait as they are useless in a lot of the murkey water enviroments and since they also mainly rely on their electroreception.</p>
                    <h3>Armato Occisor</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="armatoOccisor.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>Armato Occisor is a close relative of the Armato Rege, it's smaller due to living exclusively in the forests. It's smaller size grants it greater agility which allows it to catch the smaller and faster moving prey that lives in the forest. It also doesn't have the ability to grab things like its larger cousin but it has adapted large saber teeth which it uses to bleed out larger forest herbivores. It's stripe pattern allows it to camouflage into the shadows of the forest. Males of the species are highly territorial and will often engage in potentially deadly fights for territory. It's territory is marked using a pungent pheromone produced in a gland in it's mouth. Another interesting fact is that rarely, very rarely, Armato Rege and Armato Occisor can interbreed and create hybrids. These hybrids are rare and often die young due to neurological disorders and chronological illness.</p>
                    <h3>Rostra Pascentis</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="rostraPascentis.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>Rostra Pascentis is a small chicken like animal. It is at the absolute bottom of the food chain and has little to none defensive capabilities. They travel in huge flocks of 30 individuals and one female can lay hundreds of eggs in one mating season. They are also some of the least intelligent aliens that have been documented thus far.</p>
                    <h3>Maculosus Insidiator</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="maculosusInsidiator.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>Maculosus Insidiator is a creature that lives in creeks and swamps around the western continent, where, it plays a similar role to earth crocodillians. It lays in wait in the water, its dark brown body and dark purple spots perfectly mimicking mud and algae. When another alien approaches the water to drink, it will pop out and just like a crocodile, it will try to pull it deeper so it can drown it. It often uses its two muscular limbs to further aid in this by grabbing its prey's head and forcing it into the water.</p>
                    <h3>Cristatus Serpens</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="cristatusSerpens.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>Cristatus Serpens is a close relative to Cristatus Poncu Cursor and engage in many similar behaivors when it comes to mating. The males will dance and sing for the female, just as the Cristatus P. Cursor does. Despite their similarities, there are some key differences. Firstly, this alien is solitary and only socializes with others of its species during mating season. Secondly, this alien has better eyesight and is larger than its savannah cousin, which in turn makes it a lot more calm and far less aggressive. It's evolved to lose its limbs to make it easier for it to navigate the dense forest at its great size.</p>
                    <h3>Electrica Corniger Piscis</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="electricCornigerPiscis.jpg">

                    <p>This species is related to Electrica Interfectorem but it is very different from it's cousin. They do both hunt using electricity but this alien uses electricity in a more direct way, using it's horn(made completely out of iron) to stab prey and then electricute its prey. It is very intelligent and incredibly social and playful. They are solitary but mate for life and family members are known to meet up together every once and awhile. They have their own complex language, made up of clicks, and different families seem to have different traditions. For example, one family observed would touch horns as a greeting while another would instead wrap themselves around one another.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Spoliatus Potator: A fish similar to white suckers on earth, it uses its mouth to eat algae and to also to suction onto rocks so they don't get swept away from the powerful currents of the mountain streams where they live. They migrate down the mountain to warmer creeks to spawn.</p>
                    <p>Ferrum Senes Piscis: A small minnow sized fish that act very similarly to minnows on earth, schooling together to avoid predation. During mating season, the males become a bright purple to attract mates. The males often fight over mates and they do this through a headbutting contest, as on their head is a thin layer of iron.</p>
                    <p>Piscis Gojira: A giant freashwater fish that play a similar role to bass in the ecosytem, acting as bottomless pit and eating anything that fits in their mouth. They have spikey osteoderms on their back which prevent predation, its also the reason for it being named Piscis Gojira or Godzilla fish.</p>
                    <p>Tria Facie Anguillae: These fish are a parasitic species that feed off of the blood of larger animals. They play the same role as the earth lamprey but they take things a step further by laying their eggs into the host where they will feed off it's blood before leaving the now depleted host.</p>

                        <img src="catafractariusPecuarius.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>Catafractarius Pecuarius is a large herbivore that lives in the lowlands in the northern parts of the easter continent. They are heavily armored and rely on their sheer size and weight to bully around lesser aliens. They are incredbily aggressive for no apparent reason, its likely a response to the high amount of predators in the region, or to be specfic, the fact that there are Armato Rege in this area. These aliens like to wallow around in the streams around the lowland, similar to hippos.</p>
                    <h3>Perversi Viri</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="perversiViri.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>Perversi Viri are tall humanoid aliens that are found all across the western continent. They are incredibly intelligent and travel in tribes of 20 - 30 but there are larger tribes that may exist. These tribes mainly use primitive technology such as spears and rocks to take down prey, unlike humans who would wear down prey by chasing it for hours, Perversi Viri overwhelm their prey in ambushes. They can afford to do this as they have thick, loose skin which makes it that if they are caught in the jaws of a predator, they can turn around in their skin to fight back. Their thick skin also helps in absorbing impacts that would likely kill a human. In recent times, due to the sudden apperance of the Odientem Carnem, The Perversi Viri have aligned themselves with the Mauis Reptans, a species closely related to the Luminare Reptans, and the Luminare Reptans to begin hunting down Odientem Carnem specimens, aka flesh spires, and then burning them to the ground with fire. This alliance has allowed all three species to flourish as they combined their unique skills to create a large city in the caverns of the western continent. The Perversi Leader in this city is a male by the name of "Æøxç§".</p>
                    <h3>Sol Comendentis</h3>

                        <img src="solComedentis.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>Sol Comendtis are this planet's equivelent to earth's saurapods. They are giant and have no natural predators at max size. Sol Comendenti travel in large herds and children in the herd are raised in a communial manner, with each indivual pitching in on raising the young. Sol Comendenti act as gaurdians over lesser herbivores. Likely due to the fact that Armato Rege often feed on their young, Sol Comendenti have huge grudges against Armato Rege and will always interupt in Armato Rege hunts. There have been documented instances where Sol Comendenti will protect a lesser herbivore by stand in front of it and waving it's tail, which could kill a cocky Armato Rege.</p>
                    <h3>Fulgur Vespertilionis</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="fulgurVespertilionis.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>These fuzzy aliens live in the mountains of the western continent and during the night, their rearends glow via biolumence, similar to fireflies. Similar to fireflies, they use biolumence to attract mates. Further simularities run in the extreme sexual dimorphism, Females are larger and live exclusively on the ground, meanwhile the males are smaller and fly in the air. Often the female will canabalize the male after mating, just like how fireflies do on earth.</p>
                    <h3>Volantes Electricae</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="volantesElectricae.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>This flying nightmare is an ambush predator that hunts in a similar fashion to earth dragonflies, by laying in wait before flying at their prey with a burst of speed and snatching up their prey. The small difference in their hunting tatics, is the face they use electricity to finish off their prey. These creatures start out as larvae that float in the sky, feeding on algae until they metamorphosis into the form you see infront of you.</p>
                    <h3>Coronatus Pascentem</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="coronatusPascentem.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>Coronatus Pascentem are large, armored herbivores and one of the few that can hold its ground against an Armato Rege. It can do this due it giant horn, which is able to pierce through the armor of Armato Rege with ease. These horns are used soely for defense against predators, not for any kind of battles between others of its species. In fact, instead to find a mate, the males hold a fashion show. The males will line up and then the dominant female will decide her mate based on which male has the most attractive crown(the crown is the smaller horns behind the big one). These aliens have a large shoulder hump which is for attachments for neck muscles to hold up that giant head of its.</p>
                    <h3>Densissim Latens Venator</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="densissimLatensVenator.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>This creature fills a fimmiliar niche as bears, they are large, powerful predators but a good chunk of their diet are plants and berries. Just like how wolverine has a full metal skeleton, so does this alien with its skeleton being a majority iron. The evolutionary reason is unknown. Another simularity to wolverine is that it doesn't have claws and its claws are instead it's own finger bones which it pushes through its own skin. These aliens also have a powerful maternal instinct as they care for their young until they are nearly fully grown, whcich is 12 years.</p>
                    <h3>Mauis Reptans</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="mauisReptan.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>The Mauis Reptan is a close releative of the Luminare Reptan, the only difference is that they are a solitary Apex predator of the caverns. They still happen to be incredibly intelligent however as they often will often assert themselves into a pack of Luminare Reptans and becomes it's leader. Mauis Reptans are also very good at remembering and then mimicking sounds, this is part of their hunting strategy as they often mimic the noises of the prey they are hunting before dropping down from above and crushing the victim with its sheer mass. Males of this species tend to be larger and also have a large mane, which ussually whitens with age. A few years back a Mauis Reptan by the name of Håßü, began an alliance with a Perversi Viri tribe lead by Æøxç§. Håßü is a particularly old and cunning Mauis Reptan which allowed him to have a large pack of nearly 30 Luminare Reptans. This number only grew as him and Æøxç§ built a settlement in the caverns. This settlement now has proper walls, markets, and even a primitive form of counting to keep track of resources such as food.</p>
                    <h3>Candentis Pascentis</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="candentisPascentis.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>These are some of the largest herbivores that live in the caves. They go through a complex metamorphosis, starting off as a grub with a fan-like mouth part(similar to barnacles). During this stage of life, they absorb nutrients from the smoke of the Dator Vitae(you can learn details in the next entry). They then go through a metamorphosis and become the creature you see in front of you. They are very skittish creatures and will always avoid conflict. The 6 biolumencent bulbs on their back are to promote the growth of algae which masks their scent from Mauis Reptans and other cavern predators.</p>
                    <h3>Dator Vitae</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="datorVitae.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>Dator Vitae are the foundation of the caverns as without them, most species there wouldn't be able to exist. The cavern soil is high in nutrients but it is also high in other harmful compounds that make it impossible for plants to grow in the soil. Dator Vitae are able to filter out these harmful compounds and then release the excess nutrients via smoke, this smoke attracts small lifeforms which forms the base of the ecyosystems while at the sametime making the soil safer so that plants can begin to grow. Without Dator Vitae, the caverns would be a dead wasteland instead of the unique ecosystem.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>These aliens are medium sized ambush predators that hunt in a similar fashion to earth snapping turtles. They camouflage themselves fully as rocks and then snap up small aliens that just happen to pass by. These creatures are generally very lathargic, with slow metabolisms that allow them to go months without eating. They are also decpetivly fast in short bursts but cannot run for very far or long.</p>
                    <h3>Antrum Potator</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">
                        <img src="antrumPotator.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>These small aliens are herbivores that live in the caverns of the western continent, they use their mouth to suction onto surfaces and then a bone tongue to scrape off moss like plants. They are at the very bottom of the food chain due to their lack of defenses(their only defense is tasting bad) and also due to being sluggish fliers.</p>
                    <h3>Legione Sumus</h3>

                    </div>
                    <p>Legione Sumus is a super organism that resides in the caverns of the western continent. These aliens are very similar to siphonophores, in the sense that it is made up of millions of clones of microscopic aliens, each one is slightly different as they've specialized to do something for the greater colony. For example, some clones have a harder exterior to act as teeth while others are firm and flexiable, acting as muscles for their tentacles. They are nuisence for the cave dwelling Perversi Viri, so the Perversi Viri have devoulped rituals to repell them. These rituals work because of the herbs they use, which due to their pungent smell, repel the sensitive tentacles of this alien.</p>
                    <h3>Invisibilia Venefica</h3>
                    <div class="imageBorder">

                    </div>
                    <p>These deadly hunters live in the very deepest parts of the western continent caverns, where it is mostly darkness except for the occasional biolumencent plant or animal. The biome it lives in is severally lacking in food for something its size, so it relies heavily on animals wandering into the caves to get substantial meals. This has made them evolve to be almost vanta black so that the creatures from the surface cannot see them coming. To take down the ussually more powerful above ground creatures, they have a powerful venom that they inject into victims with their sickle-like claws. When there are no above ground creatures wandering into the caverns, they will eat small meals, using padded feet to hunt the smaller animals of the cavern depths.</p>

                    <p>These aliens that live in oceans across the planet, well not in, but more so above the ocean. They glide above the ocean, feeding on the air plankton and following air currents. The reason they only fly/glide above the ocean and haven't evolved to fly up high is because their skin is very sensitive, often needing to dip into the ocean to keep their skin healthy. They also lay their egg cases underwater.</p>

                    <p>This bird has conquered both continents of C-100, living in forests, coastlines, and any other biome that exists. This bird is incredibly intelligent, having a great memory and even the ability to mimic sounds. They are a common pet/ally to many Perversi Viri tribes, helping them locate food and other important resources like precious stones and water in exchange for food. They've also been observed to be able to learn the basic meaning behind words, similar to parrots or crows.</p>

                    <p>These creatures live in the swamps along the eastern interior seaway and are specialized to live up in the tree tops. They are incredibly social creatures, living in groups of 10-20. They comminicate using chromatophores, changing their colors to express different emotions. When it comes to communicating something objective(such as the location of a fruit tree), they use chitters and other noises. The flaps on the sides of their head can be used for temporary flight and gliding.</p>

                    <p>This giant alien lives in the oceans all across the planet, the males and females show incredible sexual dimorphism, with the males being over 10 times larger than the females. The males act as deterant, protecting the females from predators, while the females bring the males food. The males are ominivourous, using their necks to graze on seagrass on the oceafloor. These giants have entire ecosystems on their backs, filled with creatures that are specialized and who's whole evolution revolves around these giant's life cycles. When these leviathans die, their bodies attract scavengers from kilometers away to feed on the body.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The females of this species is far larger than the males, in fact, the males live inside the holes on the back of the females. The males and female work together to hunt down prey much larger than themsleves. The females will first ram into the prey, then the males will pull themselves out of their indivual holes. The males are much faster and using this speed, they flank both sides of the prey. Then, they use their mouth piece o create high-speed cavitation bubbles that, upon bursting, generate powerful shockwaves, loud snapping sounds, and extreme heat. It is very similar to how earth pistol shrimps stun their prey by snapping their claws.</p>

                    <p>A giant super preadtor that lives in the eastern interior seaway, where it hunts the largest of aliens. It's hunting strategy is to ram prey from below, the pointed tip of its skull, which in some cases instantly kills its prey but if it doesn't, it uses it's massive maw to finish it off in one bite. It's body is covered in external loops of bones that connect into one another like chainmail, this allows it to not put on too much weight but to also defend against it's biggest rival.</p>

                    <p>Terrori Oblator is a organism that has an uncanny resembelence to squids on earth but its hunting strategy is very different. It releases pheromones into the water that causes pyscological breakdowns in it's prey, its pheromone is similar to lsd or mushrooms. If this doesn't immeditly work in subduing prey, it uses its fin to flash various colors to further disorient the victim. Then, when it can no longer fight back, it will begin to consume its prey, alive. These creatures live in warm waters across C-100</p>

                    <p>On C-100 there is one civilization made up of 3 different species: The Mauis Reptans, Luminare Reptans, and the Perversi Viri. This civilization, just as our own ancient civilizations on earth, have various recipies that hold signifcance to the people of the civilization. Heres some alien recipies:</p>

                    <h1>Some really cool speculative biology projects</h1>
                    <p>These projects were the reason why I started making my own aliens in the first place and I find them super cool.</p>
                    <h2>Serina</h2>
                    <p>Serina, the world of birds, is a seed world(bassically an empty planet) which was then filled with finches as the only vertabrates. The project then takes us through millions of years of the planet's history and various epochs, showing us each creature from these eras. The story is also very surprisingly emotional near the end, im not going to spoil how because you should deffinitly check it out for yourself.</p>
                    <h2>Kappa</h2>
                    <p>Kappa, just like Serina, is a seed world but this time, instead of finches, its snapping turtles. It is a youtube series and lemme tell you this, it is some eye candy, its so beautifully animated and the designs of the creatures are just so cool. I like its focus on both the vertabrates but also on the invertabrates, which is something Serina didn't do as well, since it focused heavily on the vertabrates and very little on the invertabrates.</p>
                    <h2>The Future is Wild</h2>
                    <p>The Future is Wild is a full on documentary series about how life on earth could possibly evolve into in the future. The designs, as the name implies, are wild and it has the charm of something like walking with dinosaurs. It's overall just a really nice watch, even though it's not as indepth as something like Serina nor as beautiful as Kappa.</p>
                    <h2>Dougal Dixon</h2>
                    <p>Dougal Dixon is the author of a bunch of speculative biology books, the most famous being "Man after man" which is because of it's villain, the Qu. Out of all the things I've listed, he is deffintly the most out there and most fictional when it comes to how things ended up the way they did but he is a great author for sure.</p>
                    <h2>The Dragon Slayer Codex</h2>
                    <p>The Dragon Slayer Codex is a speculative biology project which imagines how dragons could look like if they were real. I haven't looked into this project as much but its art is super amazing and also, who doesn't love dragons.</p>
