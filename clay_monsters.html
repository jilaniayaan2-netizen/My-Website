            <h1>Clay Sculptures and Monstrosities</h1>
            <p>I've always been interested in sculpting. As a kid, I watched channels that made things out of clay and
                messed around with cheap dollar store clay. It was only until recently that I bought some clay I could
                acctually bake and began messing around. This page is to show my various clay scultures and the
                interconnected lore behind my creations.</p>

            <img src="clayKyogre.png">
            <h3>Kyogre</h3>
            <p>This was the very first thing I made with clay and was made about a year ago now.</p>
            <img src="clayGroudon.png">
            <h3>Groudon</h3>
            <p>This was the second thing I made, I mainly made it to make sure Kyogre wouldn't flood my desk.</p>
            <img src="clayLN2.png">
            <h3>Little Nightmares 2 Magnet</h3>
            <p>I had a really big little nightmares phase but wasn't skilled enough to make a figure of the charecters,
                so I opted to make this simple little magnet instead.</p>
            <img src="clayGodzillaTheBlackMass.png">

            </a>
            <h3>Godzilla the Blackmass</h3>
            <p>During this time, I discovered some a webcomic called "Godzilla The Black Mass" by steelneck95. The art
                is absolutely amazing and I love the design of this Godzilla, so I attempted to make a figure of it. Now
                this was a long while ago so now that I have a better idea of what I'm doing, I'll deffinitly give it a
                second try. Also if you want to read his series, click on the image on the left, I'd highly recommend.

            <h3>Among us and Repo</h3>
            <p>I was bored.</p>
            <img src="clayPoissonSteve.png">
            <h3>Poisson Steve</h3>
            <p>I wanted to make the funny fish.</p>
            <img src="clayInsects.png">
            <h3>Miscelleneous Arthropods</h3>
            <p>I like insects and other arthropods quite a lot, so it only made sense to make some for my desk.
                Personally, my favorite is the centipede mainly because I think it's the most well made and partly
                because I like centipedes a lot, deffinitly an underrated animal.</p>
            <img src="clayGraboid.png">
            <h3>Graboid</h3>
            <p>Graboids are these giant worm monsters from the 1990 film Tremors. I made this because Tremors holds a
                special place in my heart as Me, my dad, and my brothers did a marathon of movies 1-5 and it was a ton
                of fun.</p>
            <img src="clayShinGodzilla.png">
            <h3>Shin Godzilla</h3>
            <p>This was the first sculpture I made after buying some wire. I was still freestyling for the most part but
                instead of using only clay, I used wire and tinfoil to build a skeleton and then I added the clay one
                afterwards. This is one of my favorite sculptures, mostly because I really like Shin Godzilla.</p>
            <img src="clayBiolante.png">
            <h3>Biolante</h3>
            <p>I wanted to make another Godzilla kaiju and I was locked in intense debate, the three kaiju I was
                debating were: King Ghidorah, Destroyah, and Biolante. I eventually chose Biolante because it looked the
                least impossible to make. Don't get me wrong, I really like Biolante's design and it's very strange
                backstory, but it was up agaisnt the undisputed goats of Godzilla villians.</p>
            <img src="clayStonecat.png">
            <h3>Stonecat Trophy</h3>
            <p>I made this recently to celebrate getting the number 1 rank for the number of Stonecat observations in
                the entire world on Inaturalist.</p>

                        <p>The aptly dubbed "Ball Of Eyes" was one of
                            the first anomalies to appear on Earth, it's first sighting being May 23rd 1990. So far, the
                            Ball Of
                            Eyes has been harmless, all it does is float around and observe it's surrondings. We believe
                            its some
                            kind of living tumor, possibly from cosmic whales, which were observed feeding in the milky
                            way when the
                            Ball of Eyes first appeared. Sadly, we cannot test this theory since being it produces a
                            currently
                            unknown type of radiation which we cannot defend against.</p>

                        <p>Jared is the affectionate nickname to anomaly 167. We first learned about the existence of
                            Jared in june 7th 2001 in the town of Helen,
                            Georgia. According to our source, an older woman by the name of Martha Stewart, Jared has
                            existed in the
                            woods around the town for the past 500 years. Martha further explained that Jared was the
                            center of a
                            ritual for the women to find a husband, where they would bathe in it's pheromones. After we
                            captured
                            Jared, we tested the pheromones and were able to conclude that the pheromones have the
                            ability to
                            attract the opposite gender.</p>

                        <p>The names Gleebus and Gumbo are the
                            english pronounciations of the names of these two aliens. They came to earth in the year
                            2032 as
                            refugees from the galactic war in the Hoag's Object. Since then, they've been invaulable in
                            building
                            relationships with allies from beyond the stars. These relationships are between the Gleera
                            Civilization, the Jalarians, and the Yunams. These alliances have prevented humanity from
                            total
                            destruction from the Frodinian Empire during the intergalactic war of 2057. For this reason,
                            Gleebus and
                            Gumbo are celebrated as heroes every year on August 7th.</p>

                            as different species of fish, crabs, and cephlapods. This animal gets around the size of a
                            Bluefin Tuna
                            and it is a very commonly farmed fish due to being able to get calamari, fish meat, and crab
                            legs all
                            from one animal. Its flesh is said to be very similar in taste to dogfish but slightly
                            tougher, its 4
                            crab like limbs are often compared to king crab in taste, and it's tentacles(once turned

                            taste like most squid, just more tender due to their lesser amount of muscle.</p>

                            of Bobier. Bobier is a young elder god, what is he the
                            god of you ask? The god of holes. Being a younger elder god, he tends to get bored and as a
                            way to pass the
                            centuries, he puts holes in the hands of mortals across the galaxy. This has also made him
                            an
                            outcast, as the other elder gods find him annoying for this habit of his. If you afflicted
                            by Bobier, do not
                            panic. The holes will close on their own, though it is a painful process so we recommend to
                            sleep
                            through the process using a powerful tranquilizer.</p>

                        <p>When you look up into the sky and see the brightest star in the sky, you would be inclined to
                            inform your friends "That's the north star" but
                            you would be wrong. The True North Star is an elder god that lives within the largest
                            iceburg in the
                            north pole. It was also the cause of the great extinction event on January 4th 3045, where,
                            due to
                            hummanities own huberis, we let the ice melt. The first country to fall was Canadia, north
                            imperia followed soon
                            after. At the end of the 24 hours, the humans that didn't escape earth, had been killed. To
                            prevent
                            the entity to spread to the mars colony, humanity forced earth into a new ice age. The North
                            Star was
                            soon incased in ice once more and over the next 100 years, earth was terraformed to make it
                            liveable once
                            more but is it really earth? The species, the climate, the geography, and the even the

                        <p>The Caged Eye is an entity we found in THE VOID. THE VOID is the place where the elder gods
                            reside and as the name implies, it is the
                            essence of nothingness, in fact the nothingness is so overwhelming that the human mind
                            cannot comprehend it.
                            We were able to determine that The Caged Eye as once a judge/survillence system to keep the
                            elder gods
                            in check. It seems that it has long since retired from this job and has since had it's

                            primitivness, they are on the route of building a civilization, which makes them of great

                        <h2>The Failed Mimic</h2>
                        <p>During the 60s, the CIA needed a weapon they could use agaisnt the vietnamese during the
                            vietnam war, since their tatics were rendered
                            useless due to the gueriella warfare tatics of the vietnamese. So, the CIA funded production
                            of the mimic: A
                            monster that would be able to easily navigate through the jungle and take advantage of the
                            vietnamese supersticious culture. First, they built a simple conduit: a limestone statue
                            with biological
                            elements.Limestone was the first material discovered that could absorb souls and was used
                            for all primitive
                            conduits. Lastly, they had to input a soul into it. So, they brough forth a deathrow inmate.
                            There
                            was a malfunction though and the conduit absorbed the souls of the scientists instead,
                            contorting its form
                            from a humanoid shape to something more grotesque. The mimic then escaped, the CIA began to
                            hunt it
                            down after incidents relating to it using its star-shaped head to disguse itself in daycare
                            decorations
                            and lure in children to consume them. The Mimic was never found.</p>

                        <h2>The Star Gazer</h2>
                        <p>The first Star Gazer was built in the United Imperium in the
                            year
                            2092, and it was a huge step for the collection of Cosmic Radiation. The Cosmic Radiation
                            collected
                            was
                            for project [REDACTED]. The Star Gazer was so good at collecting Cosmic Radiation due to its
                            mix of
                            Cosmic Whale DNA and mechanical elements. Cosmic Whales are already well adapted to collect
                            energy
                            from
                            the cosmos, so it made sense to use technology to enhance their collection ability. This use
                            of
                            Cosmic
                            Whale DNA does have its side effects, those being Star Feeders. Star Feeders are parasitic
                            organisms
                            that attach to Cosmic Whales and feed off of them. Since the Star Gazer uses Cosmic Whale
                            DNA, Star
                            Feeders are attracted to it.</p>

            <h2>Inspirations</h2>
            <p>My main inspirations for the creatures I've created are Doctor Nowhere, Bobier is esspecially
                inspired by Doctor Nowhere and other similar artists. In a similar vain, Vita Carnis by Darian
                Quiloy is another inspiration, I really like the design of the meat snake and the speculative
                biology aspect of the entire series. Another inspiration for my creations are Zooliminology, I love
                the oddly cute designs of the creatures in those series. Another inspiration is Steelneck, I really
                like the very tumorous and gross look of his renditions of kaiju.</p>
