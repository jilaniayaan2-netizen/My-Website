            <article>
                Hibiki yawns, checking the date as he rolls out of bed. "March 28th, 2083," He reads aloud, rubbing his
                weary eyes. He sits on the edge of his bed, phone in hand. "Wait, it's March 28th!" He suddenly
                exclaims, scrambling to the closet of his small room on the spaceship. As Hibiki stumbles into the main
                area of the spacecraft, everyone else is already up and working.

                "Finally we are almost on the fucking planet" Abel, one of the two soldiers that NASA had put on their
                crew, grumbles, stretching lazily in his seat.

                "Shut up and stand on attention," Elena, the other soldier, scolds as she prepares her gear. Abel
                reluctantly gets up to do the same.

                Mohan, the crew's engineer, expertly begins the ship's descent with aid from the ship's AI. "Entry to
                the atmosphere successful," The AI reports. Mohan let out a breath he didn't know he was holding, moving
                his hands from the control panel, letting the AI do the easy part.

                "I can't believe we are about to be some of the first humans to see aliens ever!" Hibiki exclaims, his
                face almost pressed against the circular windows of the ship.

                "Watch, it'll probably just be another dead planet," Abel mutters.

                "No need to be buzzkill, Abel," Luh, the crew's geographer, calls out as she uses the ship's scanners to
                get a rough look at the planet's terrain.

                "I'm just being practical, every other planet NASA has checked out has been a dead waste land," Abel
                rebuts, sitting down.

                "There were at least signs of life, like the Caelum Titan fossils on D-324," Hibiki says, keeping his
                gaze out the window.

                "Keyword, were."

                The ship bursts through the clouds, and Hibiki's eyes widen. "WHOOO!" He yells, pumping his fist in the
                air. Mohan, who had been looking through the ship's camera, does the same. Everyone else scrambles to
                the various windows. Down below was a lush rainforest. The trees, if you could even call them that, were
                towering grey columns with a single greenish purple panel at the top. Smaller planets grew in and around
                the giants. Luckily for them, there was a massive savannah of red "grass" in the middle of the
                rainforest.

                As they continue to descend, Mohan notices a mass of floating creatures. He uses the camera to get a
                clearer look. "Yo Hibiki! Check this out!" He calls excitedly.

                Hibiki rushes over, accidentally pushing Mohan aside as he stares at the camera. "Those are aliens!"
                Hibiki yells excitedly.

                The aliens were travelling together in a small pod of five. They were incredibly spherical, shaped like
                a hot air balloon. Their faces looked similar to frogs', with a wide mouth and two protruding eyes. A
                reddish, swarming mass orbited the aliens, and on their backs, plants of all kinds grew.

                Abel stared out the window in disbelief, his eyes darting about, drinking in the landscape sprawled out
                before him.

                "So what happened to this being a dead planet?" Elena says with a slightly smug expression.

                Abel rolls his eyes. "Ya, I'm a dumbass. No need to rub it in."

                Hibiki had already begun to fill in an entry into the ship's database about the new aliens, using the
                scanner to get the size of the aliens. As he typed away, Hibiki was flung out of his seat, slamming into
                the wall. The ship's metal creaked and groaned as it was flung off course, and the rest of the crew
                gripped onto the walls of the ship tightly, just barely managing to stay standing.

                "What the fuck is happening!" Abel yells, attempting to run to the weapon system as the ship continues
                to tumble through the atmosphere.

                Mohan grips the steering wheel and tries to get them back on course. "Engine 1 destroyed, crash
                imminent," The AI reports as buzzers loudly blare throughout the ship.

                Hibiki pulled himself up, coughing as he looked out the window, only to see a giant yellow eye with a
                sideways pupil staring back at him. Hibiki quickly scrambles away from the window. "There's something at
                the window!" He yells, pointing out the window.

                "Elena! Where's the fucking entry key?!" Abel yells from the weapon system control panel.

                "Give me a second!" She yells back, frantically ripping through every cabinet of her desk. "Found it!"
                She yells, tossing it over to Abel, who shoves it into the key slot, activating the weapon system. He
                activates the guns, and the creature lets out a high-pitched chirp. As it lets go of the ship and flies
                off, Hibiki gets a clear look.

                The alien was long and slender, its tail being longer than its own dull, violet colored body. The side
                of its body was lined by six thin wings that propelled it like giant oars. Its face was the most
                extraordinary part; it looked like a beak when its mouth was closed, but when it opened its mouth, it
                opened into three different parts like a blooming flower, and hidden within its mouth was a long, barbed
                tongue. Then, just as quickly as the attack happened, the creature had disappeared into the thick
                clouds. Hibiki was left staring in awe, which was quickly wiped from his face as he felt his stomach
                drop. He barely managed to grip the ship's side, saving himself from getting sent flying forward.

                "LUH! TAKE THE WHEEL!" Mohan yells, rushing out of his chair and to the engine room. Luh lets go of the
                ship's wall, lunging towards the control panel, managing to grab onto the seat instead of flying out the
                front window.

                Mohan scrambled towards the engine room, climbing up the floor with little success as the ship
                nosedived.

                "Mohan!" Abel calls, holding his hand out. Mohan takes his hand, and Abel pulls him up, giving him the
                leverage to sprint up to the engine room.

                Mohan throws open the engine room door and begins to rummage through the cabinets to get some tools. The
                right engine was completely fine, but the left engine was slightly damaged; the hull had been punctured,
                and some components of the engine were covered in scratches, along with the entire area being covered in
                sticky red blood and pieces of pink flesh. It takes everything in him not to vomit from the smell of the
                steaming blood and flesh as he begins to do his best to repair the engine, using spare parts and tools.

                Meanwhile, Luh began to override the AI's control over the ship. "Entry Denied, Invalid ID," The AI
                reported in a distorted tone. Luh exhales heavily before climbing under the console and looking for the
                AI's wiring to forcefully turn it off. Her eyes darted about the mess of wires, blood rushing to her
                head as the ship continued to nose dive. "Crash imminent in-" The AI announces, its voice distorting as
                it shuts off. Luh emerges from under the console before violently yanking on the steering, causing the
                ship's nose to turn upwards right before crashing into the ground and skidding across the savannah.

                Everyone quickly rushes out of the ship and far away from it. They sit, their breath held in
                anticipation. After a minute, they breathed a collective sigh of relief.

                "At least it didn't explode," Mohan says under his breath. They all silently sit together, breathing
                heavily.

                "Holy shit, What was that thing?" Abel says.

                "No clue," Mohan says, lying down on the soft, velvety red "grass".

                "Ya, how the hell could something that big even fly??" Luh asks, sitting straight with her legs crossed.

                "That's what I'm wondering too," Elena says. "That thing was nearly as long as our ship."

                "My guess is that this planet has a thicker atmosphere and maybe more oxygen too," Hibiki answers.

                "We should wear our suits then," Mohan says, standing up and heading into the ship.

                "Why do we need our suits, I can breath here just fine," Abel rebuts, refusing to get up from his spot
                on the ground.

                "If you want to get oxygen poisoning, then be my guest, Abel," Elena comments, following everyone else
                into the ship.

                Abel grumbles, getting up and following everyone into the ship. Everyone puts on their suits.

                "Ok, the air shouldn't be toxic long term, we're looking at about 32% oxygen in the atmosphere and an
                atmosphere thickness of 423 DU," Hibiki reports, looking up from a screen on the side of his suit.

                "So I was right," Abel says smug smile behind his helmet.

                "Anyways, what's the plan now?" Luh asks.

                "Well, I should be able to repair the engine, the damage isn't too horrible," Mohan says, pausing. "But
                the spare parts container did go missing,"

                Everyone lets out a groan. "Well shit, do we know where it landed?" Elena asks.

                "There should be a tracker on the container right?" Hibiki asks.

                Luh nods. "Let me see if the ship's map is still working," Luh says, sitting at one of the consoles.
                After a moment of nothing, the holographic scene flickers to life. Everyone crowds around her, their
                eyes glued to the screen as she navigates around the map.

                "Oh look! Right there!" Abel exclaims, pointing to the top left corner, where there is a glowing red
                dot.

                "Doesn't seem too far out, we can probably get there within an hour if we take the buggy," Mohan says,
                heading to the cargo of the ship.

                Everyone else rushes after him. "Shotgun!" Abel yells, sliding into the front seat. Mohan sits in the
                driver's seat, and everyone else squeezes in at the back. Mohan puts it in reverse, exiting the ship
                before speeding up and racing down the flat savannah.

                After about 30 minutes of driving, Mohan parks the buggy behind a large alien tree, hiding from a giant
                herd of 20 to 30 aliens. Unlike the alien that had attacked their ship, these aliens had only 4 limbs.
                Their bodies are stocky, similar to a cow's body, minus the long tail. Also, unlike cows, they had 5
                pairs of eyes.

                "Whoa," Hibiki mutters, wide-eyed as he takes out his journal and begins to sketch out the aliens, like
                any good biologist would.

                "I wonder what they would taste like," Abel wonders aloud as he begins loading his rifle.

                "Maybe like a goat, could be good in curry," Mohan responds, chuckling a little.

                "Wel,I'm about to find out—" Before he could finish his sentence, Elena karate chops the back of his
                neck. Mohan snorts, quickly looking away as Abel shoots him a glare.

                "Don't eat the aliens for god's sake," Luh says, taking some more pictures.

                Abel opens his mouth, probably to curse everyone out, but is silenced by a commotion from the herd. Two
                of the larger individuals of the herd face each other, stomping their feet and scraping their hoof-like
                claws against the ground. The two do this in silence until they begin making shrill, whistling noises at
                one another. The crew stops what they're doing, now paying full attention to what the two are doing.

                "Who do you bet is gonna win?" Abel whispers to Mohan.

                "I'd put 10 bucks on the one on the left."

                "You're delusional, the one on the right is way bigger."

                The two aliens continue their whistling, now beginning to circle one another. Then they both open up a
                pair of giant, fan-like frills from the sides of their necks. They continue to whistle while shaking
                their heads, their colorful frills glimmering in the slightly orange light from the C-100 sun.
                Eventually, after a couple of minutes of this back and forth, the one on the right backs off, joining
                the rest of the herd to graze.

                "Fuck," Abel harshly whispers, he glances to his side only to see Mohan trying his hardest not to laugh
                at him.

                Sensing a crashout, Elena speaks up. "Let's get a move on, we're almost there,"

                Mohan nods in agreement, putting the buggy in reverse and going in a wide arc around the aliens as to
                not freak out the herd. Mohan suddenly stops.

                "What are you doing? let's get out of here," Elena whispers.

                "It's too quiet,"

                Everyone goes silent and listens. The herd, which earlier had been whistling and snapping at one
                another, was now completely silent. All of the aliens' heads turned to look at the treeline.

                "Let's get out of here. now," Hibiki whispers.

                Mohan nods, slowly beginning to pull the buggy out. He suddenly stops, his hands involuntarily shaking
                as he tries to grip the wheel.

                "Hey do you guys feel that–" Abel asks, suddenly covering his mouth as a wave nausea came over him.

                Everyone cowered in the buggy, covering their ears as a sudden, unseen force squeezed their eardrums and
                shook their insides. The only sounds their ears processed were the sharp, panicked whistling from the
                herd. Hibiki forces his eyes open as an alien the size of a semi truck bursts out from the tree line.
                Its mouth opened as if it were roaring, but no noise was coming out. The herd shrieks, dispersing and
                stampeding away. The giant gives chase, grabbing one of the aliens with one of its six limbs, pinning it
                before finishing it off by crunching down its neck. The unseen force that had been vibrating their
                insides disappears as the creature begins to feast.

                Abel throws up over the side of the buggy, and the others breathe heavily as if they had just run a
                marathon. After a moment, Mohan begins to pull the buggy away. Despite Mohan slowly and carefully
                pulling the buggy out from their hiding spot, the wheels softly crunch against the plants and dry earth.
                The alien looks up, its toothy maw covered in blood and guts. Its eyes focus on the buggy, observing it
                with wide pupils. As the buggy slowly pulled away, the giant alien stood still, its head tilted as its
                eyes followed the buggy.

                "What's it doing it," Elena whispers. Hibiki shrugs in response, his eyes locked onto the alien.

                "Maybe we should stop moving, it might not be able to see us right?" Abel suggests.

                Hibiki shakes his head. "Its eyes face forward, it can see us just fine."

                This silences everyone. Mohan cuts the engine, letting the buggy sit still. The alien continues to look
                at them, and Hibiki looks back, getting a perfect view of it. Other than the alien being massive, it was
                also covered in keratinous spikes and armor. Black circle markings lined its side, and its wide,
                square-shaped skull was lined with foot-long teeth shaped like daggers. It balanced itself on 4 hind
                limbs, using its hulking, muscular front limbs to pick up and tear into the grazer's body. Then it takes
                a step closer, then another, and another.

                "Let's go, now!" Luh screams.

                Mohan nods, turning the engine on and peeling out. The giant alien breaks out into a full on run, moving
                far faster than something that large should be able to.

                "We gotta jump!" Elena yells, the alien quickly gaining on them. Mohan swerves to the tree line before
                jumping out of the buggy. The others follow. The alien rams into the buggy, sending it flying into a
                tree.

                Hibiki hides in the deep grass, holding a hand over his mouth as the alien steps over him to investigate
                the buggy, which was crumpled up like a soda can.

                "Hibiki, over here,"

                Hibiki looked to where the noise came from and saw Mohan and the others motioning to him from the tree
                line. Hibiki begins to army crawl towards them, the bushy fibers at the ends of the red grass poked and
                scraped against him like needles as he crawled through. The ground beneath him suddenly begins to shake.

                "Shit," Hibiki curses under his breath as he slowly stands up and then breaks into a made dash towards
                the tree line. "HEEEELLLPP," He screams as the alien gives chase.

                Just as the alien reaches out to grab him, Elena begins to shoot at it, the bullets harmlessly bouncing
                off its hulking body. Its gaze shifts from Hibiki over to Elena. Elena fires a few more bullets. The
                lets out a low rumble before turning around and walking back to the corpse it left behind.

                Hibiki lies down on the jungle floor, panting heavily.

                "Holy shit" Mohan says slightly out of breath.

                "Let's get out of here before Rexy over there gets hungry," Abel grumbles, picking up his gun.

                "Ya, Luh which way do we go?" Elena asks.

                "We gotta go west, that's where the signal from the tracker is coming from."

                Elena nods and begins to lead the way. Mohan helps Hibiki up, and they both jog over to catch up with
                the rest of the crew. For the next hour, they walk through the alien jungle with Hibiki taking samples
                of various plants along the way. Soon they come upon a clearing, in the clearing was some more of that
                weird red grass, which Hibiki takes a sample of, along with a small pond.

                "Can we take a break?" Luh pleads breathlessly.

                Elena nods. "Ok, but we should get going soon," She says, sitting down and taking out some water from
                her rations box.

                "Imma go take a sample, be right back!" Hibiki calls out before running over to the pond. As he nears
                the pond, he slows down, his run turning into a jog and then halting to a stop. "What is that smell?" He
                mutters, covering his face and squeezing his eyes shut. After a bit, he persists and walks over, taking
                a sample of the water. While taking the sample, his eyes noticed two small fish-like aliens. They were
                around the size of a minnow and had a pointed, arrow-shaped head. He quickly scoops them up, putting
                them into a vial. He continues looking into the pond, seeing if he can spot anything else of notice. He
                gazes into the deeper end of the pond, and his eyes catch the shadow of some kind of structure. It
                didn't look like some kind of rock or plant; it had a softer, more bulbous shape to it. Just as he goes
                in to investigate, Abel grabs his shoulder.

                "C'mon, let's go already, it smells like a dead skunk here," he says, dragging Hibiki back to the group.

                "Alright alright, No need to drag me," Hibiki says, pulling away from Abel's grasp and going back to the
                others.

                After an hour of uneventful walking, they find a smoldering crater, at the center of which was a bright
                red box.

                "Finally!" Mohan yells as him and rush over to pick up the box.

                They all then begin the long trek back to the ship, walking in complete silence once more. Soon they
                reach the ship, and without missing a beat, Mohan immediately gets to work. He starts by cleaning up the
                blood and flesh, using a cloth and metal scrub to get rid of it.

                "You need some help?" Hibiki asks, walking out of the ship after putting the samples inside.

                "Nah, I got this," Mohan replies, continuing to scrub away.

                Hibiki nods. "Just let me know if you need some help," He says before walking away and plopping down
                onto the grass.

                Over the next hour, Mohan cleans the engine, replaces the scraped-up engine parts with spares, and
                finally patches up the hole in the hull by welding it together.

                "And there we go, ships done," Mohan says with a tired sigh.

                "Deploying Rovers," The ship's AI declares over the speakers as it opens the cargo hold, causing the
                rovers to rumble out.

                Everyone turns around. "What's happening?" Elena asks.

                "I don't know!" Mohan yells back.

                "Mission successful, initiating take off sequence," The AI announces and before anyone could protest or
                say anything, it takes off, leaving our crew stranded on C-100.

                Hibiki looked up blankly, watching as the ship became smaller and smaller, before disappearing into the
                clouds entirely. Hibiki's eyes drifted to other crew members.

                "WHAT THE FUCK?! COME BACK! NO YOU CAN'T FUCKING DO THIS TO ME!" Abel yelled up at the sky.

                "MOTHERFUCKER!" Mohan yelled, slamming his fist against the ground.

                Luh muttered something under her breath, her body shaking.

                Hibiki's eyes then drifted over to Elena, who, just like him, was completely silent, still looking up at
                the
                sky.

                As Mohan and Abel continued to yell at the sky, as if that would make the ship return, Hibiki's ears
                picked
                up on something. A very, very faint "whoosh" noise which quickly became louder and louder. Or closer.
                Hibiki
                launches himself at Abel, tackling him to the floor.

                "What the hell are you doing, asshole!" Abel yells in protest. Suddenly, a rush of air fills their ears
                as a
                shadow passes over them.

                "Shit," Elena mutters. "C'mon, let's get going! NOW!" She commands, Hibiki gets off Abel. He holds his
                hand
                out, but Abel brushes it off, getting up by himself and following Elena and the others into the tall red
                "grass".

                Abel stays at the back of the group while Elena stays at the front, their guns at the ready.

                How the hell did you know there was something there?" Luh asks Hibiki with a raised eyebrow.

                "Well, uh, I heard a 'whoosh' noise and it reminded me of a hawk diving," Hibiki explains, motioning
                with
                his hands while doing so.

                Luh nods. "You gotta have some kind of super hearing or something," She comments with a chuckle.

                The group continued to crouch through the tall "grass", Hibiki heard a slight rustling to his left.
                Elena
                and Abel turn to face the place where the rustling came from, their guns cocked and ready. The rustling
                continued until...3 small lizard-like aliens popped out. The aliens had long, skinny bodies and short
                limbs,
                similar to a meerkat. On their heads were two fleshy antennas, and one of them had a pair of small
                frills.
                The aliens sat on their hind legs, regarding the crew with large eyes.

                "Omg they are so adorable!" Luh squeals, stepping towards them with her hand outstretched. The aliens
                chirp
                to one another before running away into the grass. "Hey wait, come back!" Luh pleads. "I swear I'm
                friendly."

                "Sure, friendly .. " Mohan says with a smirk.

                "Shut up mohan," Luh says, rolling her eyes.

                "Well if you idiots are done looking at the aliens, we're about to run out of hiding space," Abel calls
                out
                from the back. The tall grass that the crew was hiding in was nearing its end.

                "Well shit," Luh mutters.

                A shadow passes over the group, a not-so-friendly reminder that the flying alien was still stalking
                them.

                "Well does anybody have any ideas on getting across the savannah without dying?" Luh asks.

                "We could always sacrafice Abel, for the greater good," Elena suggests with a blank face.

                Abel grumbles, flipping her off. "You got any ideas, Hibiki?" He asks, turning to face Hibiki.

                Hibiki stares off into space for a moment before speaking. "Well whatever this thing is, it isn't
                stupid.
                It's still stalking us even though it can't see us," Hibiki thinks aloud, drumming his fingers against
                his
                leg. Hibiki suddenly perks up and turns to Mohan. "Mohan, were you able to get any rovers before the
                ship
                took off?"

                Mohan nods. "I was able to snag some before the bitch took off. Are you thinking of using them as a
                distraction?"

                Hibiki nods. "Yeah, we could trying luring it down here with the rovers and then scare it off with the
                guns."

                "I think that would work," Elena says with a nod.

                "Let's go for it," Luh says, giving a thumbs up.

                "Alright then," Mohan says, reaching into his suit's backpack and taking out a metal disk. Upon placing
                the
                disk on the ground, everyone watches as wheels pop out from its sides before it races forward. A
                familiar
                whooshing is heard as the rover pops out of the grass, and a sudden gust of wind rushes through the
                grass as
                it dives right above the grass. The crew watches as the rover tries to escape its demise, but the alien
                snaps it up so fast that if you blinked, you would've missed it. Instead of flying off like earlier, the
                alien quickly grounds itself, spitting out the rover. It begins to poke and prod at the rover, allowing
                the
                crew to finally get a clear look at the speed demon they've been hiding from.

                The alien, similar to the other flying alien, had six limbs, but only 4 of those six limbs were wings;
                the
                other 2 were stubby hind legs. The alien's 4 limbs folded as it lumbered around, inspecting the now
                destroyed rover with two large, compound eyes. Its crocodile-esque jaws opened sideways like a huge pair
                of
                fleshy mandibles.

                The alien suddenly crowed out, blood spraying onto the grass. It quickly flaps its wings, taking off
                into
                the sky. Hibiki turned to look at Elena and Abel, who were now putting away their guns.

                Everyone peeked their heads out of the grass. "The cost is clear, let's go," Elena whispers. Everyone
                nods
                before making a run for it across the open savannah.

                "Wait, do you guys hear that?!" Abel yells, looking up at the sky.

                "Shit! Get down!" Mohan yells.

                Everyone drops to the ground just in time; the alien misses them by an inch, screeching as it climbs
                back up
                for another dive. They scramble up to their feet and continue making a run for it. As they run, Hibiki
                sees
                a huge cavern in the ground.

                "GUYS! OVER THERE!" Hibiki yells, pointing to the hole. "We can wait it out there!"

                They begin running to the hole, the alien diving down towards them, the whooshing filling their ears.
                Just
                as they're about to reach the hole, the ground beneath their feet shakes violently, causing them all to
                fall.

                "Is there an earthquake?!" Luh screams, her voice unheard over the rumbling of the earth beneath them.

                Suddenly, it was completely dark. The crew looks up to see the underbelly of the armored, snake-like
                body of
                a leviathan. The flying alien, unable to slow down, is snapped up by the giant's elongated jaws. The
                giant
                alien swallows the mangled corpse before lowering its body back into the cavern using two muscular
                forearms.

                The crew didn't waste a beat, continuing on their mad dash to the tree line. Once they made it into the
                forest, everyone stood around one another, catching their breath.

                "Shit, the sun's starting to set," Abel says, wiping sweat off his forehead.

                "Ya, thanks for that, Captain Obvious," Elena grumbles.

                "We need to find shelter now. If this planet is anything like Earth, all the dangerous stuff is going to
                come out at night," Hibiki says.

                "Ya, is there a cave or anything nearby?" Mohan asks.

                Luh nods, opening the screen on her suit. "The map is saying that there's one not too far from here,"
                She
                says, showing the screen to everyone.

                Elena nods. "Lead the way,"

                After about 25 minutes of walking, they arrived at the cave that Luh had shown them.

                "Oh, finally, I can rest. My legs feel like jelly," Luh says, flopping down onto the cave floor.

                Mohan takes out some more disk-shaped rovers, using them to light up the luckily empty cave. "Alright,
                I'll
                get to work on setting up the sleeping area and stuff. Can someone get some firewood?" Mohan asks as he
                begins rummaging through his backpack.

                "I'll go do it, I guess," Abel grumbles as he leaves the cave.

                In the meantime, Elena forces Mohan to let her help him set up the sleeping bags while Hibiki works on
                documenting the various species into a notebook, and Luh begins sketching out a general map of what
                they've
                explored so far. Abel soon returns, firewood in hand. After a bit, a cozy campfire has been set up, and
                everybody sits around it, eating their rations in awkward silence.

                So I already know we are all thinking this, but Hibiki, how the fuck did you know that worm-looking
                thing
                was even there?" he asks, turning to face Hibiki.

                "Well, uh, I didn't, my original plan was to go into the hole, but it worked out in the end," Hibiki
                says,
                rubbing the back of his head.

                "So what you're saying is that you had no clue what you were doing and nearly got us all killed?!" Elena
                asks harshly.

                "Well, uh, ya but I mean it all worked out in the end–"

                "We could've all died because of you!-" Abel yells loudly, his mouth gets covered by Elena.

                "Don't be so loud, we don't wanna attract anything," Elena says, taking a deep breath.

                "Guys calm down, if it wasn't for Hibiki we would've 100% died. It was a big risk but it worked out in
                the
                end. Right now we need to focus on survival." Luh says, putting a hand on Hibiki's shoulder.

                "She's not wrong, we gotta figure out how to get off this planet right now," Mohan comments, letting out
                a
                sigh.

                Elena takes a couple of deep breaths, staying completely silent before nodding in agreement.

                "Ya sure, I guess she's not wrong," Abel grumbles reluctantly, turning his attention to his rations.

                Hibiki lets out a sigh of relief before speaking up. "So how are we going to even get off this planet?"

                "Well, it'll probably take them about 2 weeks for them to send a rescue ship, and it'll probably take it
                at
                least a month to get here, since the rescue ships are built to be fast," Mohan responds, fiddling with
                his
                spoon.

                "So we gotta survive at least a month and a half here," Hibiki mutters, his voice trailing off.

                "Yup, does anyone here know any type of survival stuff? It's not like NASA taught us shit," Elena asks,
                looking around.

                No one raises their hand until Abel does.

                "No fucking way that ABEL of all people knows how to survive better than any of us," Luh says, her mouth
                agape.

                "Well–" Abel begins to explain.

                "It's cause his dad probably took him camping all the time," Mohan interjects.

                "It was my grandpa, but how'd you know that–" Abel responds.

                "'Cause you're the only American here," Hibiki interrupts with a shrug.

                "Ya fair enough," Abel says, shrugging.

                "Well then, Mr.survivalist, what should we do tomorrow?" Elena asks mockingly.

                "Well, we gotta find water obviously, so tomorrow we'll look for water, then we'll make a shelter by the
                water. For food, we should ration until we, by we I mean Hibiki, figure out what's safe to eat here."
                Abel
                responds quickly, so he's not cut off again.

                "Well, for water, there's a river system about 12 km due north," Luh says, pointing to it on the map she
                copied from her suit's screen.

                "Huh, that's pretty convenient. Let's get some sleep then. We've got a lot of walking tomorrow," Elena
                says
                as she crawls into her sleeping bag.

                "Night," Mohan says, dousing the fire with water before crawling into his sleeping bag.

                "Yeah, whatever. I guess I'll also go to sleep, night," Abel says as he, along with Hibiki and Luh, also
                goes to sleep.

                Hibiki wakes up to strange chirping noises coming from outside the cave. "Hm? What's that noise?" He
                mutters, his eyes slowly absorbing the morning light filling the cave. As he looks around the cave, his
                eyes
                widen. "What the hell are those–" He whispers to himself, looking at the source of the chirps.

                The aliens that were making the noises were 3 dog-sized aliens. They were covered in black armor plating
                and
                carried themselves using a prehensile tail and two arms. Their face was smooth and notably lacked eyes.
                This
                pack of aliens was now entering the cave.

                Hibiki slowly slips out of his sleeping bag and over to Abel. "Abel, wake up," Hibiki whispers, shaking
                him
                slightly.

                "5 more minutes, Mom," Abel mumbles sleepily, turning onto his side.

                "I'm not your mom, Abel. Wake up!" Hibiki hisses.

                The aliens turn their heads to Hibiki, sniffing the air for a moment before slowly beginning to make
                their
                way towards them.

                "C'mon, Abel! Wake the hell up, I don't wanna die!" Hibiki whispers again, shaking Abel harder. Hibiki's
                eyes drift over to his lunchbox. He rips open his lunch box and grabs his rationed water before dumping
                it
                onto Abel's face.

                "AH WHAT THE HELL!? I'M GONNA BEAT YOU TO DEATH!" Abel yells at the top of his fucking lungs as he sits
                up.

                The aliens suddenly stop before turning their heads to the cave entrance and loudly shrieking before
                running
                full sprint towards Abel and Hibiki. Three more aliens run into the cave, joining the rest of their
                pack.

                "WHAT THE HELL ARE THOSE THINGS?!" Abel screamed, grabbing his gun. He begins to shoot at the aliens,
                but
                the bullets bounce off their armored bodies with little effect. The gunshots, combined with Abel's
                unintelligible screaming, wake up the rest of the group.

                "Huh? What the hell is happening, bro–" Mohan mutters before scrambling out of his sleeping bag as an
                alien
                jumps on top of it and rips it to shreds.

                Elena gets up, grabs her gun, and starts to shoot at the aliens as well. "What the-! They're
                bulletproof!"
                Elena calls out, lowering her gun before lowering Abel's gun too.

                "WHAT ARE YOU DOING BITCH–" Abel yells at her.

                "Don't waste your bullets on these things, dumbass," Elena hisses.

                Abel shuts up, knowing that Elena is right. The alien pack begins to circle them.

                "Ah shit," Luh mumbles under her breath before turning to Hibiki. "Got a plan?"

                "Uh they're blind, so maybe we can distract them and run?"

                Elena nods, picking up a rock and chucking it further into the cave. It hits the wall, making a loud
                clunk.
                The aliens look to where the noise came from and then at one another, letting out a series of loud
                chirps
                that sounded like laughter.

                "Oh shit, that didn't work–" Abel says as one of the aliens lunges towards him. He bashes it away with
                the
                hilt of his gun. "WHAT DO WE DO?!" Abel screams as the alien pounces back onto him and tries to bite
                him. In
                a moment of desperation, Abel shoves his gun into the alien's mouth and holds down the trigger.

                "Ah gross," Abel mutters as blood and bits of organs gush out from the alien's mouth and all over his
                suit.

                The other creatures stop in their tracks. Smelling the blood of their comrade, the aliens let out
                panicked
                screeches as they scrambled out of the cave.

                "THAT'S RIGHT YOU BITCHES RUN!" Abel yells with a grin, throwing the alien's dead body to the ground.

                "HELL YA YOU DID IT! WHOOOO!" Mohan screams, dapping up Abel.

                Abel continued to celebrate his victory with a little victory dance and more yelling. "OW–" Abel
                exclaims,
                holding the top of his head.

                "As much as I appreciate you saving us, try not to bring every single thing in the jungle toward us by
                yelling like a monkey," Elena says, picking up her bag.

                "You don't gotta keep hitting me," Abel grumbles something under his breath as he picks up his bag.
                Everyone
                else does the same, with Hibiki picking up the alien's body and shoving it into his bag.

                "What're you doing?" Luh asks, raising an eyebrow.

                "Well, if we want to survive here for the month we need to before a rescue ship comes here, we gotta
                figure
                out if we can eat them," Hibiki responds with a shrug.

                "I am not eating that, it looks nasty as hell," Luh replies. "Wonder how you would season it though,"
                she
                thinks aloud.

                "I CALL COOKING, IMMA MAKE SOME FIRE CURRY!" Mohan exclaims, pumping his fist into the air.

                "Well I gotta figure out if it's edible first–"

                "NUH UH, I'M MAKING IT INTO BURGERS!" Abel yells back at Mohan. Everyone hearing this turns and stares
                at
                him.

                "I think your cooking would probably kill us, I trust Mohan on this one," Luh says, Hibiki and Elena nod
                in
                agreement.

                "Damn," Abel mutters, looking downwards. Mohan, meanwhile, struggled not to burst out laughing.

                "Let's get going now before some other ungodly alien pops up," Elena says, going to the front of the
                group.

                The crew begins the 12km trek towards the river, and for most of the journey, it was the same old
                rainforest. This changed at the 11km mark, though.

                "Whoa," Hibiki mutters, his eyes darting around to take in the new landscape in front of him. The
                previous
                rainforest had faded away and had now become a vast, monotonous expanse of light purple bamboo-like
                plants.

                "Huh are we in China or something?" Abel jokes with a smirk. Elena glares at him, which he ignores as he
                saunters past her.

                Luh stayed at the back of the group, trying copy down as much of the map from her screen to paper before
                the
                screen's battery died out. As she continued to write, Hibiki noticed her perking up at something.

                "Did you see something move?" Luh asks him.

                "See what–"

                Luh just barely manages to dodge what looks like a bamboo stalk, which pierces the ground next to her.
                "RUN!"

                "WHAT ARE WE RUNNING FROM?!" Abel yells.

                "AN ALIEN OBVIOUSLY!" Luh yells at him.

                "CAN'T WE JUST LIGHT IT UP?!"

                "WE CAN'T SHOOT SOMETHING WE CAN'T SEE, BRO!" Mohan shouts.

                Hibiki turned his head back to see what was chasing them. It looks like normal bamboo forest, squinting
                hard, Hibiki notices that some of the bamboo was a slightly darker purple, the bamboo he was looking at
                then
                moved. "THE LIMBS ARE A DARKER PURPLE GUYS!" Hibiki calls out.

                "Abel! Pass me the machete!" Mohan yells back, holding his arm up.

                Abel nods, tossing the sheathed machete over to him. Mohan catches it and then slashes at a bamboo stalk
                that was slightly darker than the rest. A loud howl is heard followed by the crashing of bamboo as the
                alien
                retreats.

                "Nice one, bro," Mohan says to Hibiki, his hands on his knees as he catches his breath.

                "Thanks," Hibiki responds, taking out his water flask.

                "Good work," Elena says, with a nod.

                Luh looks at Hibiki with a perplexed expression but doesn't say anything, instead sitting down on the
                ground.

                "Looks like we're here," Abel says, looking forward.

                In front of the group was the single best thing that a tired and thirsty astronaut could see, the river.

                "FINALLY WATER!" Abel whoops, pumping his fist into the air. Mohan yelled just as loudly and fist bumped
                Abel.

                "Pipe down, you two," Elena grumbles. "So what now?"

                Abel cleared his throat. "Well, our best bet would be to find a cave near the river."

                Luh, who was lying on the ground, spoke up. "I can use a drone to map out the area,"

                "I grabbed a drone from the ship before it took off," Mohan says, rummaging through his bag. "Found it!"
                Mohan exclaims, producing a small drone from his bag.

                "Thanks," Luh says, getting up from the floor and taking the drone from him.

                "I guess we can just chill in the meantime," Mohan states before lying down on the ground.

                Hibiki had taken out some basic equipment from his bag: a microscope, a notebook, a scalpel, and
                tweezers. He then took out the corpse of the alien and, with a surgeon's precision, Hibiki began to cut
                open the alien. He investigated the alien's flesh, comparing it with that of species from Earth.

                Abel and Elena sat down next to each other, holding their guns as they patrolled the area.

                "So, how many bullets do you have left?" Abel asks. "I got 2 mags left,"

                "About the same here, we gotta save our bullets now, cause we can't waste resources to make more
                bullets," Elena responds.

                "Ya, that's true,"

                Some time passed, and everyone did their own thing, taking the time to recuperate. Abel and Mohan joked
                around with one another while Elena paced around diligently. Luh was still piloting the drone around the
                area, and Hibiki was still cutting apart the alien with the scalpel, continuing to compare it with Earth
                animals and running other tests on the flesh.

                "GUYS, IT'S EDIBLE!" Hibiki exclaimed.

                Mohan, who was lazing about, immediately sat up. "Hell ya! Wanna help me get some firewood so we can get
                cooking?"

                "Ya sure I don't mind tagging along," Hibiki says, standing up and following behind Mohan.

                They began to walk back into the bamboo forest, and soon, they reached a patch of dry bamboo. Mohan
                began to chop down the bamboo, and Hibiki sat down on a nearby rock.

                "So..." Mohan began, pausing to see if Hibiki was listening. When he saw that Hibiki was looking at him,
                he continued. "Sorry bout Abel freaking out at you last night. I think you did the right thing
                yesterday."

                "It's all good. I can see why he would get so mad. I was being pretty reckless," Hibiki responds,
                rubbing the back of his neck.

                "Ya, but he was still in the wrong, it's not like you were trying to get us killed on purpose," Mohan
                said, picking up the pile of bamboo he had cut.

                "I guess, but it's not a big deal," Hibiki said with a shrug.

                As Hibiki and Mohan grab the cut bamboo to take it back, Hibiki stops in his tracks, whipping his head
                to look behind him. "Did you hear that?"

                "Hear what-" Mohan responds before Hibiki pulls him down behind a large boulder.

                They hear a rustling coming from deeper in the bamboo, and out from the darkness of the bamboo forest
                comes... a medium-sized, 4 legged alien. The alien clumsily walked over to a bamboo stalk before using
                its scissor-like head, which made up for half of its body length. Then, using its strange headgear, it
                cut down the stalk of bamboo into bite-sized pieces and then swallowed them whole.

                "Oh, it's just a herbivore," Hibiki says, breathing a sigh of relief.

                "Alright, let's get going then, I'm starving," Mohan replies.

                Mohan and Hibiki soon joined the rest of the group, who were still all doing their own thing. Elena was
                using some binoculars to look up at the sky, Luh was still piloting the drone, and Abel was doodling and
                adding notes in Hibiki's field guide, earning a glare from Hibiki. Hibiki takes his book back from Abel
                and sits down to add some new entries. While Mohan gets straight to cooking. Hibiki began writing about
                the alien that Mohan just killed.

                30 minutes slowly tick by, and a rich, mildly spicy aroma floats through the air. Abel perks up, waking
                up from his slumber to sit down next to Mohan.

                "Damn, something smells good."

                "I know it does, nothing better than some good curry."

                "Why curry of all things? We should've used the alien to make burgers or something." Abel grumbles,
                staring hungrily at the bubbling of the curry in the fire.

                "Guys! I found a cave, it's across the river though," Luh says, walking back to them, eyes glued to the
                tablet's screen. As she gets closer, she perks up. "Damn, that smells really good," She says, drooling
                at the sight of the curry. Luh joins Abel in hungrily waiting for Mohan to be done.

                Another 30 minutes later, Mohan begins to serve the curry in everybody's empty ration tins.

                "Fuck that's good," Abel hums, giving Mohan a thumbs up.

                "Thanks, bro, it's my mom's spice recipe," Mohan responds with a grin.

                Abel's calm face suddenly contorts into a devilish grin. "You know, I could eat like this every day,
                maybe ya should introduce me to your mom when we get back home–"

                Mohan punches Abel in the shoulder. "What is it about you and old women? It's concerning, really," Mohan
                says, both of them sharing a chuckle.

                Luh slowly chews the curry with a pensive look on her face. "Uh, Mohan, what'd you use to make this? It
                tastes like a tougher chicken," She says.

                "Oh, I used that alien, the uh, what did you name Hibiki?"

                "The Lesser Tree Crawler,"

                "Yup, that thing,"

                "Huh?" Luh mutters, the color draining from her face.

                "Ya, it's alien, did you think we had chicken or something?" Mohan says, glancing occasionally over at
                Abel, who was full on staring at him with the dumbest look on his face.

                As the realization that she just ate some gross, disgusting alien dawns on Luh's face, Mohan now
                struggles not to laugh as Abel continues to stare at him.

                "WHAT THE FUCK?! YOU'RE TELLING ME I'VE BEEN EATING AN ALIEN THIS ENTIRE TIME?!" Luh finally yells.

                Abel bursts out laughing, causing Mohan to laugh as well. Abel doubles over, rolling on the floor
                laughing as Luh continues to rage out.

                Their laughter is cut short by Elena smacking them both on the head. "Are you trying to get us ripped
                apart by some new alien?!" She scolds before sitting back down. "Also, the curry isn't bad for alien
                meat."

                "I agree, I actually like this a lot more than some curry I've had back home," Hibiki says, putting down
                his now-empty tin.

                "Thanks, bro," Mohan says with a smile. "Damn, you absolutely crushed that curry," Mohan says, his eyes
                drifting to the empty tin.

                "Ya, I was pretty hungry," Hibiki says softly, rubbing the back of his head.

                "Fair enough, we haven't eaten anything decent for a while now," Mohan says, going back to eating.

                Once everyone is done eating, Luh stands up. "Anyways, now that you guys are done eating... that, we
                should find a way to cross the river,"

                "We should build a raft," Abel says, standing up and grabbing his machete.

                "Sounds good to me," Elena says, doing the same. "Abel and I can gather the material," She says before
                they both head out into the forest.

                "I guess we're stuck designing the raft," Mohan says, getting up with a groan.

                "You mean you are," Luh says.

                Mohan just sighs.

                Soon, the group had put together a simple raft using bamboo and vines to build a flat base and then
                using some of their spare clothes to sew a sail together.

                "And the St. Sammy is now ready to sail!" Abel exclaims.

                "Hey! How come you get to name it?" Luh protests.

                "No, we're naming it Kinerma," Elena interjects matter-of-factly.

                "Nah uh!"

                "Yah huh!"

                Luh sighs, watching them both break into an argument. Mohan and Hibiki wait by the edge of the river,
                making random small talk.

                "What kind of name is 'st sammy'?! A ship's name should be majestic like my home village of Kinerma!"
                Elena yells, crossing her arms.

                "Wow, your random russian town in buttfuck nowhere is so majestic–" Abel retorts.

                "I think we have bigger problems at hand than the name of this shitty raft. Can we just get going?!" Luh
                yells.

                "Fine, fine. I'm still naming it St. Sammy," Abel grumbles.

                "You can shove your St. Sammy up your ass–" Elena mutters.

                Everybody joins Mohan and Hibiki at the water's edge and pushes the raft into the water. Elena uses a
                long piece of bamboo as a quant pole to push the raft across the river. As she does so, Abel stares down
                at the water absent-mindedly when something catches his eye. Standing out from the aquamarine color were
                3 off colored fleshy orbs, floating in the current.

                "Huh, what're those?" Abel mutters to himself before reaching out to touch one of the orbs. "Ah shit!"
                Abel hisses, pulling his hand back. "The thing electrocuted me!" Abel yells to everyone, who promptly
                ignore him. "Thanks a lot, assholes," Abel grumbles under his breath, going back to looking at the water
                absent-mindedly.

                Elena rolled her eyes and went back to pushing the raft along the river. She suddenly found herself in
                the air, the quant pole slipping out of her hands. The raft crackled loudly as it flipped, sending
                everyone into the water. Everyone quickly swam back up to the surface.

                "Is everyone ok?!" Elena calls, her eyes scanning the area and doing a mental headcount.

                "Ya! What did we get hit by?!" Mohan asks.

                "Well, probably some new alien–" Elena says before getting dragged under.

                Mohan quickly dived under after her. The water was a murky greenish blue, and visibility was low, with
                little light penetrating it. He continued to swim under when his eyes caught the movement of Elena's
                hand. He quickly grabbed her hand and began pulling, only to get pulled away along with Hibiki.

                Abel grabs the machete from his bag before diving down after them. He swims downstream and catches a
                glimpse of the alien. Its body was long and slimy-looking, similar to an electric eel. Its jaws were
                currently clamped around Elena's ankle, trying to pull him away from Mohan. The grossest thing about the
                alien was the hundreds of deep holes all across its body.

                "God, thats so nasty," Abel thought to himself as he swam down, machete in hand. The water turns red,
                and the alien lets out a shriek, letting go of Elena as it twists and writhes, trying to get Abel off of
                it. Mohan finally pulls Elena away from it and swims with her up to the surface, putting himself on the
                raft.

                "Where's Abel?!" Mohan yells, gasping for air.

                "He went in after you and Elena!" Luh replies.

                Mohan nods, taking a deep breath before diving back under.

                Mohan finds Abel, loosely holding onto the machete as the alien twirls under the water. Mohan pulls out
                the machete and scoops up Abel before swimming back up to the surface.

                "I feel so numb," Abel groans as Hibiki and Luh pull him up onto the raft.

                "Shit, what do we do now? The fucker is gonna circle back," Mohan exclaimed, rapidly pulling himself up
                with the machete in hand.

                "Abel, what happened?!" Hibiki asks, limping over to him.

                "It electrocuted me, like those stupid balls–" Abel grunts, rolling on his side.

                Hibiki's eyes shoot open. "Maybe it's like an electric eel!" He calls out, rummaging through Mohan's
                bag, pulling out one of the drones and turning it on before throwing it off the raft.

                "What are you doing?!" Mohan cries out, watching his drone sink into the water and then get ripped apart
                by the alien's jaws. Elena quickly begins to push the raft along, and once they reach the shore,
                everyone piles off the raft and onto the bank.

                "Nice one, Hibiki," Luh says, letting out a heavy sigh.

                "Ya, nice one, now let's get going–" Elena says, letting out a sharp hiss as she takes a step forward.

                "Elena, let me help you out–" Mohan offers.

                "It's ok, I'll be fine," She replies quickly before starting to walk forward despite a slight limp.

                "Help?"Abel wheezes from the ground. Mohan helps him, putting Abel's arm over his shoulder.

                Luh leads them towards the cave, and after about an hour of walking, they reach a small, secluded cave.
                The cave was surrounded by many plants, and the inside was sandy and soft. Just a few meters in front of
                the cave was a large, slow-flowing creek. Everyone settles down in the cave, taking their time to take a
                breather.

                Hibiki sits right outside the cave and by the creek, watching various aliens come and take a drink from
                the creek. He didn't see much until he finally saw something move through the vegetation, which soon
                revealed itself by coming into the clearing of the creek.

                It was absolutely massive, probably the second-largest alien that they've seen thus far, with a long and
                muscular body, similar to a giant python. On the sides of its neck were two small frills, and it looked
                around with its 4 pairs of eyes.

                It lowered its head and began to gulp down water from the stream. After having its fill, it began to
                scoop up and eat the thick aquatic vegetation. As it chewed, it suddenly stopped, turning to the jungle
                behind it.

                Out of the vegetation emerged another alien. It was clearly a predatory alien, with a long snout like a
                shrew and sharp teeth. Four of these teeth, two on the top and two on the bottom, were elongated, like
                the teeth of the saber-toothed tiger. Unlike the other aliens that they've seen, it was covered from
                head to toe in fur, which was mostly a rich, earthy brown with the occasional black or green vertical
                stripes. Much like the giant armored alien from yesterday, it also had six limbs, which were accompanied
                by a long tail.

                Hibiki tensed, expecting a fight to start, but he was mistaken as the predatory alien simply approached
                the creek and drank its fill before sauntering away into the jungle. Hibiki didn't observe much else for
                the next half hour or so before finally closing the book and putting it away. "Well, we should probably
                go out and get some supplies," He says, standing up and stretching.

                Luh nods. "Yup, me, you, and Mohan can head out, since Abel and Elena are injured."

                "Hey! I'm fine, why don't one of you stay with him instead?!" Elena protests.

                "You're ankle is all fucked up, you need to rest, Elena," Mohan replies, grabbing Abel's gun and machete
                from him.

                "But–"

                "Nope! Now see ya!" Luh quips before leaving the cave with Mohan and Hibiki in tow.

                "HEY WAIT, DON'T LEAVE ME HERE WITH HIM–" Elena yells to no avail.

                Once the three of them are far enough away from the cave that Elena and Abel can't hear them, Luh speaks
                up. "Do you think this'll help them from arguing all the time?"

                "Well, it'd be nice if they do, cause I don't want those two titans to start fighting," Hibiki says with
                a chuckle.

                "C'mon, they aren't that much taller than us," Mohan replies.

                "Well, they're like a foot taller than Luh–" Hibiki says.

                "Hey! Why am I catching strays!?" She exclaims.

                "Hey, it's not like he's wrong–" Mohan pitches in.

                "Ow–" Mohan and Hibiki exclaim, rubbing their heads.

                "Were you both saying something?"

                "Nope,"

                "Good, let's get this over with."

                Back at the cave, Elena struggles to get Abel off his ass and to get him to start cleaning up and
                organizing their current supplies.

                " Just get up and help me make the cave livable," she says, standing in front of Abel with her arms
                crossed.

                Abel blinks a couple of times before responding. "Can't we just relax? My body feels like jelly," he
                says, leaning back further on the cave wall.

                "No, we have to do our part and get this place ready," She responds promptly.

                "Can't you cut me some slack? I just got electrocuted by some stupid alien," Abel grumbles.

                "Fine, I guess I'll just do it myself," Elena says with an exasperated groan, hobbling away from Abel
                and beginning to organize and clean up the cave.

                Abel leans back, watching Elena struggle to clean. After watching this painful display for a few minutes
                longer, Abel speaks up. "You know, Elena, you should just chill out, you're injured and exhausted. The
                other can help us out when they come back."

                "Well, I can't just sit down and be lazy while we're stranded on a fucking alien planet,"

                "Well, me and you have been doing a lot of fighting and saving the others, it won't kill ya to take a
                break when you're injured."

                "So what? Now they're out there getting the supplies, I'm not just going to sit around and do nothing."

                "Working to exhaustion and making your injury worse helps no one."

                "Whatever. I'm not gonna be lazy like you," Elena says, rolling her eyes before going back to her work.

                Abel just sighs and goes back to resting. He continues to watch Elena hobble around the cave, trying not
                to put too much weight on her sprained ankle. Abel decides to walk over to try to convince her to take a
                break, but as he does so, Elena trips on a small crevice in the cave. Abel manages to catch her just
                before she hits the ground.

                "I told ya that you're too tired to do anything right now."

                "Shut up," Elena grumbles, pulling away from Abel and standing back up.

                "Elena, seriously you should take a rest," Abel says, but before he could continue, a low growl echoes
                through the cave.

                The two's bickering ceases, Elena grabs two sticks, tossing one to Abel. They quickly use some vines to
                tie their pocket knives to their sticks, making two makeshift spears. They stand back to back, staying
                in the middle of the cave. The minutes slowly tick by, with nothing happening.

                "Well, it seems that was all about nothing," Abel says with a shrug, dropping his spear and walking back
                to his spot by the wall.

                Elena is about to do the same when she sees a blur of movement from the corner of her eye. "Abel, get
                down!" She yells before tackling him to the floor just in time as the tiger-like alien that Hibiki saw
                earlier lunges over them, gracefully landing behind them.

                "Oh shit!" Abel yells, scrambling to his feet and diving out of the way as the alien lunges at him
                again.

                Elena grabs her makeshift spear and throws it at the alien, aiming for its head. The spear barely
                penetrates its thick hide and fur. It ignores the spear in its side, continuing to chase Abel around the
                cave. As he continues to run around the cave, he slides over to the spear he dropped, just in time, too,
                as the alien manages to pin him down. It goes to bite him, but Abel holds it off using the shaft of the
                spear.

                "ELENA, DO SOMETHING, I DON'T WANT TO DIE!"

                Elena looks around and spots Hibiki's bag; she quickly begins to rummage through it and finds a flint
                and steel. She begins to frantically hit them together, trying to get a spark on the stick.

                "ELENA HURRY! IT'S GONNA BREAK!" Abel cries out, his spear cracking as the alien pushes its jaws closer.

                Elena picks up a rock and throws it at the alien's head as hard as she can. The alien stops and turns to
                look at Elena. It gets off of Abel and bounds toward Elena, who has one hand behind her back.

                "C'mon . . ." Elena mutters under her breath, bracing herself.

                Just as it's about to lunge, she shows what she was hiding behind her back: a torch. The alien halts as
                Elena shoves the fire in its face. "BACK!" she yells at it. The alien growls at her, but it continues to
                back up. The alien stares at her and growls one last time before running off. Abel stays on the ground
                and lets out a massive sigh of relief.

                "Good to be alive," Abel says, sitting up.

                "Yup .. well I should probably get back to getting the cave ready–"

                "C'mon, really?! We both nearly just died, so let's take a break to rest," Abel says as he stands up.

                "Ya, but we gotta pull our own weight," she says, crossing her arms.

                "True, but we both are exhausted, so instead of overworking yourself and injuring yourself, which would
                drag everyone down with you, just relax for once."

                Elena thinks for a bit. "I hate that your logic makes sense," Elena says with an annoyed sigh, sitting
                down by the cave wall.

                Abel is about to sit down next to her when he spots something. "Oh look, Hibiki left his field journal
                behind," He says, snatching it up from the floor and plopping down next to her. He begins to flip
                through the book before suddenly stopping. "Huh, check it out, Hibiki saw the alien that attacked us,"
                He says, showing Elena the page.

                "Oh, how did he even find one?"

                Abel shrugs. "But he named it 'Armato Ocissor', no clue whatever that means."

                It's Latin for armored killer, didn't you pay attention when they made us learn Latin for the mission?"

                "Well, I forgot, alright! It's not even important. Anyways, we beat this thing, so we should get to make
                our own note in here," Abel says, grabbing a pen and beginning to draw on the page.

                "Who are you even drawing??" Elena asks, leaning over to watch him draw.

                "Myself obviously."

                Elena sputters. "PFT– That looks more like an alien than an actual person!" Elena says, holding back a
                laugh.

                "It does not! I'd like to see you do better!" Abel says, tossing the notebook at Elena.

                Elena catches the notebook. "Sure,"

                Abel leans over to watch her draw. Elena does a quick sketch of herself, and Abel watches, his mouth
                agape. "What the fuck? How are you of all people good at drawing?"

                "Well I used to draw a lot when I was younger," Elena responds, putting the notebook and pen down.

                "Huh, never took you for the type of gal who liked to draw," Abel says, a contemplative look on his
                face. He stops to think, something rare for him, before continuing. "So do you still draw?"

                "Well uh no, I don't really draw anymore."

                "Why'd ya stop? You're really good at it," He says, looking at her sketch next to his drawing.

                "Uh, it's complicated," Elena says quietly.

                Abel nods. "Ah, alright, I ain't gonna push you on it." He says before taking the pen and opening its
                cap. "I know just what to add to this," He says before adding a text bubble writing a quick message in
                it. "Boom, done and dusted," He says, tossing the book near Hibiki's bag along with the pen.

                Meanwhile, Hibiki and the others had been able to collect some water from the river while narrowly
                escaping an ambush predator that fills a similar niche to that of crocodiles on earth, and collected
                some wood without any big incident. Now they are foraging and hunting for food.

                "These plants are edible," Hibiki says, plucking out a reddish purple leafy plant.

                "Nice," Luh responds, gathering some different plants that Hibiki determined are also edible.

                Meanwhile, Mohan was walking around in thick vegetation, looking for something to hunt. Luckily for him,
                he finds a flock of 4 legged aliens that were about the size of a chicken. Mohan aims and shoots 3 of
                the aliens; the rest scamper off as Mohan goes to collect the bodies.

                "WHOO LET'S GOO! WE EATIN' TANDOORI CHICKEN TONIGHT!" Mohan exclaims, holding the aliens over his head.

                "Woohoo!" Hibiki exclaims, giving Mohan a fist bump.

                "Damn, your aim isn't ass, surprisingly," Luh taunts. "But tandoori chicken sounds great," Luh adds, her
                mouth watering.

                "Hey, my aim isn't that bad, but you'd better be excited for some tandoori chicken!" Mohan says with a
                smile as the group starts heading back. As they head back to the cave, a loud bellow echoes through the
                forest.

                "What the hell is that?" Luh asks, gripping her gun tighter.

                "Oh, that sounds like this alien I saw at the creek. I named it Cristatus Serpens. From what I observed,
                it's just a big herbivore," Hibiki says nonchalantly and continues on his way.

                The large, snake-like alien bursts through the trees in front of them, rushing right past.

                "Wait, was that another alien in its mouth?" Mohan asks with a raised eyebrow.

                "Uh, ya .. . I have no clue about that, and its eyes were all glazed over too," Hibiki says nervously.

                Luh curses under her breath. "Whatever, let's just get moving before it turns us into a snack or
                something."

                The three of them soon arrive at a semi-clean cave with Elena and Abel sitting around a bonfire in the
                middle.

                "Yo, you're back, how'd it go?" Abel asks, getting up to greet them.

                "Went pretty well for the most part, and we got some chicken-looking things," Mohan says, holding up the
                3 aliens he had shot.

                "Looks perfect for some barbeque," Abel says excitedly.

                "We are turning this into tandoori chicken, not some shitty American BBQ," Mohan says, holding the
                aliens tighter.

                "HEY AMERICAN BBQ IS GREAT, WAY BETTER THAN FUCKING TANDOORI CHICKEN,"

                "OH YA? LET'S SETTLE THIS LIKE MEN!" Mohan says, rolling up his sleeve.

                "BET!" Abel yells back as Mohan tosses one of the aliens to him. The two head to opposite ends of the
                cave and begin cooking.

                "Huh, I thought they were gonna fight," Luh says, disappointedly.

                "I bet 15 bucks that Mohan is gonna win the cook off," Hibiki says as he, Luh, and Elena sit down to
                watch the cook off.

                "Hibiki, there's no need to bet, there's not a single chance that Abel creates something edible, let
                alone beating Mohan," Elena says.

                "Fair point," Hibiki responds, grabbing his field guide and starting to add some new entries to it.
                After about an hour or two of cooking, both Abel and Mohan present their dishes to everyone else.

                "Watch this curry muncher, imma blow you outta the fucking water!" Abel declares cockily as they both
                place their dishes down. Everyone starts with Mohan's dish, which is, as always, delicious, before
                moving on to Abel's dish.

                "I'm a little scared to bite into this to be honest," Luh says with a gulp.

                "Same here," Hibiki says before he takes a bite. As expected, Abel's food was barely edible.

                "Ya Mohan wins by an astronomical amount," Luh says after taking a bite.

                "Told ya, bro, you cannot cook for the life of ya," Mohan says, patting Abel's back.

                "Shut up," Abel grumbles.

                "Anyways, since I'd rather not get food poisoning from whatever Abel made, and we're all still hungry.
                So, I'll cook the final alien," Luh says as she gets up and heads over to the cooking station. After
                about 45 minutes of cooking, Luh made a dish similar to chicken stroganoff.

                "Damn, this is actually not that bad," Abel remarks as he eats.

                "Thanks, it's my mom's recipe," Luh says as she eats as well.

                "You know, maybe you should introduce me to your mom–" Abel says with a devilish grin. "Ow!'' Abel
                exclaims, rubbing the back of his head. "Why do you keep hitting me, Elena!"

                Everyone laughs as the sun sets, bringing the end of their second day here on C-100.

                "Do you remember? The 21st night of September, love was changing the mind of pretenders, and chasing the
                clouds away," Abel hums to himself while using a tin container to wash himself. "Yo, can somebody fill
                this for me?" Abel calls out, waving the now-empty container over the makeshift shower wall.

                "Sorry bro busy right now," Mohan replies absent-mindedly as he tinkers with his suit's communication
                unit.

                "Same here," Hibiki says, adding new entries to his field guide.

                Elena doesn't respond, still fast asleep in her sleeping bag.

                "Fine, I'll do it," Luh grumbles, walking over and snatching the container from her. "Don't know why you
                need 5 of these to wash yourself everytime," mutters under her breath before walking out of the cage and
                to the creek, which is where they got all their water from. Luh suddenly stops, standing at the bank.
                "And of course it's fucking dry," She groans, running a hand over her face before making her way back to
                the cave.

                Once Luh returns to the cave, she tosses the container over the shower wall. The hum of Abel's off-key
                singing was interrupted by a loud clang followed by a raging yell. "HEY, WHAT WAS THAT FOR?!"

                "The creek's gone dry," Luh says with a sigh.

                "What?! It was running just fine last night!" Abel shouts, rushing out from behind the shower wall,
                haphazardly throwing on a t-shirt and shorts.

                "Well maybe cause you use 50 buckets per shower," Luh jeers.

                "Very funny, now cmon let's go check it out," Abel says, grabbing his gun and machete.

                "Can I tag along too?" Hibiki asks, suddenly perking up from his field guide. "If the creek is
                completely dry, then I can see some alien fish,"

                "Sure, more people means I get back to my shower quicker," Abel announces before striding out of the
                cave, Luh and Hibiki in tow.

                On arriving, Luh and Abel head out to see if something is blocking the creek's flow, while Hibiki heads
                down into the empty creek to see what kinds of aliens are there. Hibiki documents a variety of species,
                most of which have two movable fins, like fish on Earth. He continues down the creek when he's suddenly
                hit by a putrid smell; it smells like rot and decay, but even more pungent. His eyes teared up from the
                smell as he covered his nose with his shirt. Despite the horrible smell, he continues onward,
                approaching whatever the source of the scent is.

                "What the . . ." Hibiki mutters, his voice trailing off with wide eyes. In front of Hibiki was a roughly
                foot-tall mound of amalgamated flesh and bones from multiple species. On the top and side of the mound
                were the skulls of two Luminare Reptans; across the rest of its red, blister-ridden body were many eyes
                of varying sizes and shapes. These eyes then suddenly roll over, now looking at Hibiki. A lump forms in
                his throat, taking a small step back from the abomination. The lump of bleeding, gooey flesh, continues
                to track Hibiki's movements with various eyes. A lump on its body begins to pulsate, causing dark,
                rotten-smelling blood to flow out of it before it finally spits something out towards Hibiki. Hibiki
                looked down at his arm, sticking out from the cloth of his sleeve, a tiny barbed stinger.

                "Probably venomous," Hibiki thinks aloud, carefully plucking out the stinger and placing it into a glass
                container. "At least I have a sample of whatever that thing is now," He says, walking away from the
                creature.

                Hibiki continues to walk away at a brisk pace, his mind racing in the silence of the empty creek, trying
                to figure out what that thing was. His thoughts are roughly interrupted, however, as the silence is
                replaced with the roar of rushing water.

                Hibiki's eyes widen, and he scrambles over to the side of the creek to climb out, only to slip on the
                mud and fall backward onto the floor, and is swept up by the rushing water. He just manages to push his
                head above the water, gasping for air, whilst looking for something to grab onto. His eyes catch a root,
                sticking out from the bank of the creek. He makes a desperate lunge for it, just barely managing to wrap
                his fingers around it. He swiftly pulls himself up onto dry land, collapsing onto his back and breathing
                heavily.

                "Hibiki, are you ok?!" Luh yells, running up to him with Abel in tow.

                "Barely," Hibiki croaks out from his spot on the ground.

                "Shit, I'm so sorry, I didn't know that you were down there!" Abel says, quickly helping Hibiki up from
                the ground.

                Hibiki coughs. "It's fine, just a heads up would've been nice,"

                "Yeah, our bad . . ." Luh apologizes, rubbing the back of her head.

                "So, did you find any new species or anything?" Abel asks.

                Hibiki's eyes widen, and he begins frantically patting down his pockets. "IT'S GONE! NO!" Hibiki yells,
                turning his pockets inside out.

                "What's gone?" Luh asks.

                "There was this alien and I took a sample and– fuck! It's gone!" Hibiki sputters, clenching his fists.
                He takes a deep breath and exhales. "It's fine, just forget about it,"

                Abel opens his mouth to speak, but stops as Luh elbows him in the ribs, shooting him a glare. Abel
                clears his throat. "Well then, I'll just fill up my container then," He announces, awkwardly walking
                over to the creek and scooping up some water.

                While filling up the container, an eel-like alien pops out of the water. Similar to the alien that
                attacked them on their raft, it had more than just 1 pair of eyes and a tall sailfin on its back. Its
                head and jaws are short and broad with many rows of sharp teeth. On its head was a single horn, like a
                unicorn's. It's 4 eyes curiously, looking around at the group, letting out soft shrills as it playfully
                splashes around.

                "What the hell is that dumb looking thing?" Abel says, splashing water at it in an attempt to scare it
                off.

                "Hey, I think it's pretty cute," Luh says, digging in her pocket and producing a piece of dried meat,
                which she then throws to it. It catches the piece of meat mid-air and eats it.

                "Well, it might attack us or something," Abel says before throwing a rock at it, which it dodges before
                splashing Abel with water.

                "Abel, careful, it kinda resembles that big electric alien–" Hibiki warns, but it was already too late.

                "AH WHAT THE FUCK?! OW! IT ZAPPED ME!" Abel yells, which scares off the creature. Luh laughs her ass off
                while Hibiki holds back a laugh himself.

                After this, the 3 of them head back to the cave, but Hibiki couldn't get his mind off the flesh mound.

                "What the hell was that thing? It was clearly alive," Hibiki mutters under his breath as he begins to
                sketch it into his field guide. The image of its bleeding, rotten body, composed of the corpses of
                various aliens, was fresh in his mind.

                It was pretty quiet in the cave as the group each did their own thing when suddenly Mohan broke said
                silence.

                "YO GUYS, I GOT THE COMS BACK UP AND RUNNING, COME QUICK!" Mohan exclaims, beckoning everyone over with
                hand gestures. Everyone drops what they are doing and rushes over to him. Mohan takes a calming breath
                before speaking into the radio. "This is the crew of the Apollo 15, do you read?"

                The radio buzzes with static for a moment. "Yes this NASA HQ, what is your status?" The voice of the
                operator crackles over the radio. Cheers erupt from the rest of the crew before Mohan clears his throat
                and responds to NASA HQ.

                "We are currently in forests of the planet, we are about 10 kilometers from the landing site." Mohan
                responds promptly.

                "See, we sent an extraction unit to the planet 4 days ago. The extraction unit's trajectory will be
                towards the base of the mountains, which should be north of your landing," NASA HQ responds. A glowing
                dot appears on the screen of the communications device.

                "Alright we will be right there to meet the extraction unit, when will they arrive?" Mohan asked.

                "We will be there in approximately 3 days at 1400 hours. We hope to see you then," NASA HQ responds
                before cutting communications. After they cut communications, everybody starts getting ready to travel
                to the location that NASA marked for them.

                "Man, I can't wait to take a nice hot shower once I get back home," Abel says, stretching as they begin
                their walk.

                "Same, we smell terrible bro," Mohan chuckles, handing the device to Luh so she could lead the way.

                "Ya, it's gonna be nice to finally go home but I hope I can document a couple new species while I'm
                here," Hibiki says, staying at the back of the group as they begin the journey to the base of the
                mountains.

                "I'll be a hero to my mom once I get back but I already know my mom is gonna scold me for worrying," Luh
                says, letting out a tired sigh just thinking about the upcoming lecture.

                "At least you'll get some stroganoff afterwards," Mohan chuckles.

                "Fair point, chicken stroganoff is heavenly," Luh says.

                "I want to have some Pelmeni when I get home," Elena adds.

                "Pelmeni? The hell is that? I'm looking forward to some juicy steak," Abel replies, practically
                drooling.

                "It's like dumplings, I like mine with sour cream," Elena explains.

                "Sounds pretty good, maybe we should get some once we finally get outta this place," Hibiki says before
                adding on. "I want some Takoyaki, though, I miss good seafood."

                "Psh, as if I'm going to Russia of all places, I'd rather not freeze to death–" Abel starts before Elena
                smacks the back of his head. "Ow, that was uncalled for," Abel grumbles, rubbing the back of his head.

                "What about you, Mohan?" Hibiki asks.

                "I'll give you 30 bucks, it's Nihari with butter naan," Abel says

                "And you're damn right! Nihari blasts your greasy ass burgers straight outta the water," Mohan replies.

                "Ya right! We'll see about that, you curry muncher!" Abel exclaims, grinning.

                "Bet, I'll destroy your sorry ass!" Mohan says, also grinning.

                "I'm putting all my money on Mohan," Luh and Hibiki say at the same time.

                "Same here, my dad, while drinking vodka, could cook better than Abel," Elena adds on.

                "Jeez, thanks for the support, you guys," Abel grumbles.

                "Well, we should probably get a move on; we have to cover 195 km in only three days," Luh says, picking
                up her pace, the rest of the group following in her steps.

                The sun was quick to set, shrouding the jungle in an impenetrable darkness. Despite this, they continued
                to move on, huddled close to one another.

                "My legs are jelly!" Luh whines, hobbling along at the front of the group.

                "Shouldn't we rest now? It's so late," Hibiki says, yawning widely.

                "We still have 135 km left to go, we can set up camp in an hour," Elena insists, having taken the map
                from Luh a long while ago now.

                Abel puts a hand on Elena's shoulder, giving her a tired look. Elena sighs, her features softening.
                "Fine, let's set up camp."

                The group quickly set up camp, gathering around a bonfire in their sleeping bags. Elena stood guard,
                ignoring Abel's advice entirely. She stood marching back and forth, her eyes glued to the void that was
                the forest. As alien as this planet was, the forest still had a nostalgic feel to Elena. There were so
                many differences between the forest she explored back home and the one here. The forest back home was
                snowy, cold, and so quiet. Here, it was wet, uncomfortably humid, and noisy. There was one thing both
                forests had in common: the feeling of dread. To her, it has always felt like the forest has had eyes,
                especially at night. There was always something watching you in the forest: the birds, the insects, and
                the thousands of other creatures. She rubs her eyes tiredly, shaking her thoughts about the forest, how
                she could wander too deep and never be found. Her eyes drift away from the darkness and instead to
                Hibiki's backpack. She quietly sneaks over and retrieves the field guide. She flips through it, adding
                her comments to the aliens she found interesting. Once she finishes adding her comments, she flips
                through the entire book before suddenly stopping at the very last page.

                "What the . . ." Elena murmurs, her voice trailing off.

                The final page, which should be empty like the 100 pages before it, was a secret entry. The alien drawn
                was rotting, gunky flesh from various species crudely stitched together into a messy lump. The sketch
                was messily done, unlike every other alien drawing Hibiki had done. Her eyes then drifted to the note on
                the side, done in scribbled, messy handwriting.

                "I have no clue what this thing is. It smells terrible, like a rotting skunk. Its anatomy makes no
                sense! It has body parts from other aliens. I don't know what it is or how it does anything but I will
                try to observe it further. – Hibiki Ito."

                She slams the book shut, shoving it into Hibiki's bag before going back to her patrols, pacing back and
                forth faster than before.

                A few hours later, the crew wakes up just as the sun peaks over the horizon. They eat a quick breakfast
                before resuming their journey. A few hours later, they exit the jungle, the space opening up into a
                grassland. Unlike the savannah, which was made up of pure red plants, the grassland was made up of many
                diverse species of grass-like plants. It wasn't a flat grassland; the grassland was made up of many
                rolling hills with patches of trees scattered throughout. In front of them was a river that cut through
                grassland, and the mountains loomed far off in the distance.

                "Whoa! This place is beautiful! This gotta be one of the biggest mountains I've seen!" Luh says, taking
                a few pictures of the entire landscape.

                "Ya ya whatever, I just want to rest. My legs are done," Abel grumbles.

                "Same here, we should eat something too," Mohan says.

                Hibiki nods in agreement.

                "We can go rest by the river, C'mon, let's go," Elena says, leading the way down to the river.

                Mohan plops down by the creek, scooping up the cold mountain water into his hands and splashing it on
                his face.

                Abel immediately ransacks Mohan's bag and takes out the leftovers from today's breakfast.

                Hibiki looks across the river, where about 20 meters away a bipedal alien lazily wallows around in the
                water. Its legs were similar to an elephant's, thick and column-like. Its legs are the opposite of its
                arms, however, as it's arms are incredibly tiny. It used its huge head to graze on the grass on the bank
                of the river. He took out his field guide, flipping to an empty page and beginning to sketch it in.

                Abel sniffs, his nose scrunching. "Huh, what's that smell?"

                Hibiki and Elena suddenly perk up. Hibiki takes a deep breath. "Ya it smells pretty bad here, we should
                probably move," Hibiki says quickly, his eyes locked on something deep in the river.

                "Well, you're not wrong, it does smell terrible here," Mohan says with a small nod.

                "Nah, you must love it. Bet it smells like home for you here," Abel says, grinning before Mohan punches
                him in the shoulder.

                "If you think this is bad, you guys wouldn't last a day in Delhi," Mohan chuckles before going back to
                eating.

                Mohan and Abel roughed around as usual, making dumb jokes and hitting one another. Hibiki, meanwhile,
                continued to stare deep into the water. He squinted his eyes, focusing hard on something down there. Luh
                continued to eat her food, occasionally taking pictures or videos of the surroundings. Elena sat further
                away from the creek, observing Hibiki from the corner of her eye.

                A bellow suddenly ripped through the air. Everyone whipped their heads over to the source of the noise,
                the herbivorous alien. It was bucking, rolling, and thrashing, as if it was trying to get rid of
                something that wasn't there. It even went so far as to begin smashing its head against the walls of the
                riverbank until thick blood tainted the waters.

                "Hibiki, its eyes are all fucked up!" Luh points out.

                "Yeah, they're just like the eyes of that big snake alien," Mohan adds.

                Hibiki looks at the alien's eyes. The eyes were milky white, lacking the pupils they had earlier; more
                noticeable than that, a stinger was poking out of one of its eyes. "Let's get out of here," Hibiki says,
                his voice shaky.

                He didn't have to tell them twice, as everyone immediately began packing up their things.

                Another pained bellow ripped through the air once more before the alien went silent entirely. The sound
                of restless thrashing and resistance was now replaced by the sound of it rushing through the water.

                "IT'S COMING, LET'S GO!" Elena yelled as everyone made a mad dash towards the treeline.

                By the time the alien emerged from the river, the group had already taken cover by the treeline. The
                alien lumbered about, moving as if it were its first time walking. It would take a step and then fall,
                step and then fall, a pattern that repeated multiple times. The alien looked around, its head pivoting
                like a security camera. Its face was incredibly deformed from its struggle; the eyebrow ridges on the
                right side of its face had collapsed, and the skin had been scraped off, exposing raw, pink flesh
                underneath. Its stubby arms were both broken and crumpled up from falling. It continued its walk
                forward, slowly and calculated, like a robot. Soon, it was right by the treeline. Just as it was about
                to continue, its head snapped towards the sound of rustling from its bushes. A small alien darted out
                from the bushes, only to get immediately snatched up by its jaws, its flat teeth flattening the lesser
                alien with a sickening crunch. It didn't continue to chew nor did it swallow, instead it slowly walked
                back to the river before submerging completely within its depths.

                "Jesus Christ, what the hell was the big dude's problem?" Abel mumbles to the others as they all come
                out of their hiding spots.

                "I don't know, but that's enough resting for now. Let's get the hell out of here," Luh says as they
                begin walking again.

                Only a few hours later, night had already fallen. Everyone had settled into their sleeping bags, except
                for Abel, who stayed up on watch. Elena had tried to stay up on watch again, but Abel refused to let
                her. He sat down on a tree stump, his rifle in hand, but he was wide awake. Usually, Abel would fight
                back sleep at this hour, but that wasn't the problem he faced right now. Instead, he faced a different
                issue; He was being watched. At least it felt that way. He stared ahead to see if he could catch
                something darting out from behind one of the trees that were scattered across the grassland, or to catch
                the reflective glint of nocturnal eyes. All his eyes met was the suffocating darkness of the grassland.

                "Man, this planet must be making me go skitzo or something," He mutters, running a hand over his face.

                He turns around to check the other side when the quiet sound of footsteps catches his attention. They
                sounded human, like someone was sneaking around their camp. He slowly turns around, gripping his gun
                tightly. He prayed his hunch had been wrong, but as his father would say, "Fate is a cruel mistress,"
                and he really wasn't wrong. Peeking out from behind the tree was a face. The face was far from human,
                its eyes were far too small and noticeably lacked pupils, its nose was thin and flattened, and it lacked
                any external ears. Its skin was loose, wrinkled, and saggy, with its skin being a noticeably
                greenish-yellow tint. The creature, instead of ducking back into the cover of the tree, matches Abel's
                stare. This staring contest lasts for what to Abel seems like hours until it finally slinks back into
                the darkness. Abel didn't have any trouble fighting back sleep for the rest of the night afterward.

                A few hours later, the crew all woke up, and an hour after that, they had all begun the final stretch of
                the trip. Everyone assumed their usual positions in the line; Hibiki walked tiredly at the back, Mohan
                walked next to Hibiki, and Luh and Elena stayed at the front. Abel, however, charged ahead, for once
                being at the very front of the group. In his hands, his rifle was tightly gripped, and his eyes were
                never focused in front but instead to his left and to his right.

                "Hey bro you good man?" Mohan asks Abel while the rest of the group walks on ahead of them.

                "Ya, I'm good, man," Abel responds absent-mindedly, looking out into the woods.

                "Bro, don't pull that shit. You look like you've seen a skinwalker or some shit," Mohan responds.

                "Fine, I'm just nervous about the whole alien thing yesterday," Abel says.

                "Can't blame you, that thing went berserk out of the blue," Mohan responds with a small chuckle.

                Abel nods. "Yeah, Hibiki, do you know what that was all about?"

                Hibiki shakes his head. "No clue, maybe it was sick with something similar to rabies?" Hibiki pitches.

                Luh nods. "I guess that one snake thing was also infected."

                "What snake thing?" Elena asks.

                "There was this big snake thing and its eyes were all milky white, just like the big guy yesterday," Luh
                responds.

                "Don't forget the dead alien it was carrying around," Mohan adds.

                "Jeez, that's mad creepy," Abel says with a shudder.

                "This planet is just creepy in general. I can't wait to get home," Luh says with a sigh.

                "The second I'm getting home, I'm going to go bird watching," Elena says.

                "You birdwatch?!" Abel exclaims.

                Elena raises an eyebrow. "Yeah, what's so surprising about that?"

                "I always thought you would have more violent hobbies," Abel says bluntly.

                Elena's eyebrows furrow. "What're you trying to say, huh?"

                "Well, you're a very mean person in general, how can you blame me–" Abel begins, losing the opportunity
                to finish as Elena begins to chase him.

                Luh and Mohan chuckle as Elena tackles Abel, leading to a wrestling match between the two, all the while
                Hibiki is staring off into space, staying completely silent.

                "Earth to Hibki, you there?" Luh asks, waving a hand in front of his face, snapping him out of the
                trance he was in.

                "Huh?" Hibiki mutters tiredly, turning his head side to side.

                "Are you ok? You seem really tired," Luh asks as Mohan cheers Abel on in the background.

                "Yeah, just haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately,"

                "I feel you, it's hard to sleep when you aren't in the safety of a cave,"

                Hibiki nods. "Yeah, I think it's just this planet in general,"

                "It's way too humid, like it's even more humid than my grandma's house in Brazil,"

                Hibiki chuckles. "It is super hot and humid. Even though we've been here for two weeks, I can't get used
                to,"

                "Yeah," Luh says with a smile. The two of them walk side by side, catching up to the others.

                The group soon arrived at the foot of the mountains, the extraction point. Currently it was almost 1400
                hours, meaning within an hour, the rescue crew would be coming. Everyone sat around in a circle, taking
                cover under a large tree-like organism. Everyone sat in their own little groups, talking or doing some
                other activity.

                "When we get home, we gotta hop on the game," Abel says to Mohan.

                Mohan nods. "Agreed, it's been 2 whole years,"

                They both go silent. "Damn," they say simultaneously.

                "That's insane, isn't it?" Mohan asks.

                "Yup,"

                The two go silent for a moment longer before getting back to discussion.

                "At least there will be a ton of new content," Abel says.

                "True, true."

                The conversation between them died down and they sat there in silence, enjoying each other's company.
                Abel looks up from the piece of wood he had begun carving with his pocket knife, something his father
                had taught him to do, and looks toward the treeline. The same feeling from last night had filled him
                again. His eyes darted about until they landed on a familiar face. Except, it was just one, it was five–
                no it was even more, his eyes widened as he saw alien after alien after alien hiding behind the trees.

                "Dude, what's wrong?" Mohan asks. When Abel doesn't respond, Mohan follows his gaze to the treeline.
                "Holy shit," Mohan says under his breath.

                "We need to go," Abel says, getting up, rifle in hand.

                Hibiki looks up from his field guide. "Why? Do you see something?"

                Abel motions to the treeline, everyone turns their gaze and sees the alien faces.

                Elena immediately stands up, drawing her rifle. "Abel's right, we have to go, now," Elena commands.

                As the group packs up, a loud sound pierces through the air. The sound repeats itself a second time,
                then a third before being joined by lowing rhythmic humming.

                "Is that a horn?" Luh asks, as another loud sound blares out, this time coming from their right instead
                of the tree line in front of them.

                "Well, whatever they are, they've surrounded us," Elena says, gripping her gun.

                The hum continues before suddenly stopping, the noise being replaced with the sound of over 50 of the
                aliens running towards them. Now seeing the in the daylight, Abel could get a clear look at what he now
                knows had been stalking them ever since last night. They were tall, very tall, with each of them being 8
                to 9 feet tall and their skin wasn't just wrinkly, it was loose and sagged off their bodies. Their limbs
                were long and their fingers were sharp and bony, like claws. Some them carried primitive weapons like
                sharpened wooden spears, clubs, and rocks, which the lobbed forward, similar to how chimpanzees on earth
                could.

                Elena and Abel opened fire, killing many of the aliens charging forward. They didn't stop coming at
                them, only a few stayed back to drag off the dead and injured. Hibiki, Luh, and Mohan gripped their
                machetes tightly, staying close to Elena and Abel, who continued to shoot the aliens, who had now begun
                to cower behind trees before returning fire by throwing rocks and spears. Whilst distracted with that
                group, another group of 10 had already snuck up behind them. Just as one was about to lunge at Hibki,
                Mohan tackled it to the ground. Mohan attempted to slash it with the machete while having it pinned, the
                alien turned around in its own skin and bit down on Mohan's hand, thrashing it's head back and forth
                violently.

                "HELP!" Mohan cried out.

                Luh came up from behind the alien, slamming the machete into it's skull, splitting it into to two. Hibki
                and Luh circled Mohan, machetes in hand as they guarded him from any other aliens.

                Abel gun clicks. "Shit, I'm out of ammo!" Abel yells, tossing the gun to the side and pulling out his
                machete.

                "Same here, I'm all out!" Elena replies.

                The aliens began closing in on the group, at first cautiously coming out from their hiding before
                breaking out into a full on run towards them. However, they come to a screeching halt halfway through. A
                deep rumble filled the air, vibrating their very bones. The aliens began hollering in panic as they made
                a desperate run for it as a giant alien bursts out of the tree line. It was the same species as the
                alien they had met on their first day here. It runs rampant, chasing after the fleeing humanoid aliens,
                snapping them up in it's jaws. Soon, all of them had disappeared into the forest.

                "Thank god," Abel says breathlessly.

                It then turned its attention to them. It looked at them the same way as the one they first met had. It's
                small pupils, slowly looked over them one at time, getting each minute detail of their appearance.
                Everyone stood still, breath held, as it analyzed them. Then it begun to walk towards them, first it was
                slow tentative steps but soon became confident and deliberate strides.

                "Oh we're so fucked," Abel says.

                "This isn't time for your adlibs, Abel," Elena scolds him. "Hibiki, got any ideas?"

                "I have no clue, we definitely can't outrun it, we're too far from the tree line."

                Just as it got halfway to them, a loud whirring noise came from the sky. It looked up before running
                away as bullets rained down towards it.

                "THANK GOD IT'S HERE!" Mohan says, offering a weak high five with his good hand.

                "ABOUT DAMN TIME, HOLY SHIT!" Abel says giving the high five.

                "Thank god," Luh whispers under her breath.

                However, their happiness was short lived as two aliens flew towards the ship, it was two of the aliens
                that had crashed their ship in the first place, now making a bee line towards the their only way out.
                They could only watch as the two aliens clamped onto the ship, piercing it's engine. The rescue ship
                managed to scare off the aliens but it was too little too late, as it spiralled out of control, crashing
                somewhere far away near the mountains.

                The horn sounds once more, the group's attention snaps back to the treeline, where the tribal aliens had
                returned. The horn sounds again, the crew picks up their machetes, even Mohan, holding it in his good
                hand. The horn sounds for a final time as the aliens rush in once more.

                A red blur suddenly rushes past them and in the blink of an eye, the aliens had all been slaughtered,
                pieces of their body strewn about the area and in the middle stood a short lightskinned woman, being at
                most 5'1. The woman had locks, which were a dark cyan color. Her clothing; a primitive looking dress
                made from some kind of plant fiber with a vine that acted as a belt. All these details flew past the
                group however because the thing they focused on the most was her left eye, a cybernetic that glowed a
                bright red, and her right arm which was split down the middle, with a giant, dark red and bloody blade
                coming out of it.
